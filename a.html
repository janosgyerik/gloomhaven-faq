Official FAQ for Game (no rules questions please)

Official FAQ for Game (no rules questions please)
<b>Introduction</b><br/><br/>This is the official FAQ for all Gloomhaven related issues (the previous thread has been deprecated - this one replaces it). It covers all Revisions of the game. The Revision 2+ rule books are nearly identical. Many of the entries are already part of the R2+ rule books. However, since not everyone has the latest revision, those entries will remain in the FAQ. If an entry applies to a specific revision, it is noted as such (R1, R2+). Otherwise, the entry applies to all versions.<br/><br/>Note that the actual rules for the different revisions of the game are the same, and one of the purposes of this FAQ is to make sure their interpretations are in alignment. There were some minor changes to cards made for R2+ but these aren't rule changes, they are typo fixes or small balance changes (see this <a  href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1761512/official-second-printing-change-log"   >thread</a>)<br/><br/><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Please limit discussions in this thread to requests for clarifications, improvements and corrections to existing entries and to requests for new entries. If you have a question that you feel is not covered in this FAQ or in the rule book, please create another thread in the Rules forum, preferably with just one question (or related questions) per thread. If it turns out that it is not covered by the rules or the FAQ, go ahead and post a comment on this thread to request its inclusion. I'm subscribed to the entire forum so hopefully I will see it and do it myself but feel free to do so ahead of me (or if I miss it).<br/><br/>The FAQ is organized into sections to improve readability. Also, CTRL-F (or whatever Mac guys have) is your friend, use it. Entries covering monsters, locked classes, items and some scenarios are covered in spoilers sections. It is suggested that you read over those sections when you reach a point in the game where you encounter them.<br/><br/>Note: I am not the designer of the game, that is of course Isaac. However, I am helping to update and manage the FAQ in my spare time because I enjoy stuff like that (yes, I’m aware I'm a freak ), I want to give back to the community of such a great game, and because Isaac is a hell of a lot more busy than me right now and the FAQ really needed an update. Also, I am the author of the <a  href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/142767/rules-summary"   >Rules Summary</a> document in the files section. It has received lots of good feedback and we have all endeavored to make it match the formal rules (including the FAQ). I mention it only in the interest of providing as much info here to make it as easy for everyone to play and have fun with the game.<br/><br/><br/><b>General Scenario Game Play</b><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Abilities - Skipping, Order, Timing and Separate/Attached</b></font><br/><br/><b>Can I choose to not perform specific parts of an action and what is considered a negative effect?</b><br/><br/>You may not skip the following abilities/effects:<br/><pre>  * </pre>Negative effects: Effects that when performed will (not may) reduce hit points, lose cards, or apply a negative condition to yourself or an ally .<br/><pre>  * </pre>Stand alone infusions (i.e. not attached to a specific ability). Note that infusions gained from modifier cards are considered attached to the attack so they can be skipped. Also, for characters, at least one ability on the action must be performed in order to gain the standalone Infusion. This is not true for monsters, they cannot skip abilities and do perform their infusion even if they can't perform another ability during their action.<br/><pre>  * </pre>XP granting abilities, whether standalone or attached to another ability. If standalone, at least one ability on the action must be performed in order to gain the XP.<br/><pre>  * </pre>+/- X ability adjustments from modifier cards.<br/><pre>  * </pre>Individual targets of an AoE attack - if you do the attack, all eligible targets in the area must be attacked. Note that Add Target and Target X are not AoE abilities and can be skipped. For Target X, you may attack less than X targets.<br/><pre>  * </pre>Charges and their effects of a multi-use item or ability if the triggering conditions have been met<br/><br/>You may skip any other ability or effect, including some or all effects attached to an attack but you must chose to do so BEFORE drawing an attack modifier card. Some modifier cards have their own attack effects and you can choose to apply them after you draw if they qualify as optional effects.<br/><br/><b>Can I change the order of the abilities in an Action?</b><br/>No, any abilities that you choose not to skip must be performed in the order listed in the card<br/><br/><b>Are separate attacks from an ability (like an AoE) resolved separately or simultaneously?</b><br/>They are resolved separately in any order the player wishes. Separate attack abilities in the same attack action are resolved in the sequence they are written. No attacks are resolved simultaneously. You resolve one attack, including any additional effects of the attack like push/pull or retaliation, then resolve the next attack.<br/><br/><b>When an ability says "Do X to get Y", do I get Y, regardless of the results of X?</b><br/>X and Y happen simultaneously so you always get Y. However, you may still not be able to benefit from Y if X causes you to be exhausted and Y is an effect contingent upon you doing something after your are exhausted (like resolving an attack or moving).<br/><br/><b>When an ability has a conditional bonus (like Move 4, Add +2 move if X is true) when is the condition evaluated?</b><br/>The condition is evaluated before you perform the ability. So if during the move something negates X, you still get the +2 move bonus.<br/><br/><b>When are abilities that say "on your next attack action" (and similar) actually triggered?</b><br/>They trigger after declaring the target of the first attack but before drawing the modifier card.<br/><br/><b>If a card or item grants an extra action that happens at the end of the turn, when exactly does it occur with respect to other end-of-turn activities?</b><br/>The extra action occurs before other end-of-turn activities. Think of it as a third action performed after your normal two actions.<br/><br/><b>If two effects are both supposed to happen at the beginning of a turn (such as a wound and a beginning of turn heal), which happens first?</b><br/>Players decide.<br/><br/><b>How do I know if an ability/effect is attached to the prior ability or is a separate ability?</b><br/> - Abilities with large fonts are considered separate abilities<br/> - Due to card size constraints, sometimes a separate ability will have smaller font. However, these will have more spacing between them to denote they are separate abilities.<br/> - An ability/effect that references the preceding ability is attached to that ability and will typically be printed with small font.<br/><br/>Below are examples of attached and separate abilities<br/><div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5243103"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/PSOXohkQbxfHNQebeJUQi-vOB0Y=/fit-in/200x150/pic5243103.jpg" border=0></a></div><br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Ability +X vs Ability X Cards</b></font><br/><br/><b>What is the difference between “Ability +X” vs “Ability X”?</b><br/>“Ability +X” makes an adjustment to an existing ability while “Ability X” grants the figure a new ability. <br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Active Area, Card Recovery, Discarded Cards, Losing Cards</b></font><br/><br/><b>If I play a card for its basic action, but the corresponding action on the card has the lose symbol, do I still lose the card?<br/></b>No, only if you perform that specific action text does the lose symbol take effect.<br/><br/><b>If I recover cards during my second action, can I recover the card I just played with my first action?<br/></b>Yes. As soon as a card is used, it is placed in the appropriate pile, so if your first card played is lost, you could recover it with your second card if it allows for such.<br/><br/><b>What is the designation of cards in my active area? Are they considered in my hand or in their own class or what?<br/></b>Cards in your active area MAY be moved to the discard or lost pile (depending on their symbol or the symbol of the action which placed them there) at any time and in order to meet game requirements, so you can think of them as already discarded or lost. When you recover discard cards (by resting, for example) or lost cards (through special actions), you have the choice of picking up corresponding cards in your active area OR leaving them in play. Discardable cards in the active area may be lost to negate damage (technically moving them to the discard pile first). Cards in the active area are not considered to be in your hand. When evaluating battle goals at the end of a scenario, the cards are considered discarded or lost.<br/><br/><b>If a card has the lost symbol, do I have to perform all abilities on the card to lose it?<br/></b>No, performing any ability on the card causes you to lose the card. However, you do not lose the card if you play it as a basic Attack2 / Move2. You must perform some ability of the action to actually lose the card<br/><br/><b>Can you lose cards to resolve damage prior to using defense abilities or items?</b><br/>Yes<br/><br/><b>Do persistent cards that trigger “at the end of your next X turns” also trigger at the end of the current turn?</b><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>When are abilities from Active Bonus cards granted?</b><br/>Active bonus abililties (like shield, retaliate, +X Attack, abilities from consumed charges on the card, etc.) are granted when the card is played and while the card is in the active area - and only if the requirements for the ability/effect are met. Other abilities listed on the card that aren't active bonus abilities are granted when the card is played. For example, Mindthief's Feedback Loop grants an Attack 1, Shield (if the Attack is made) and XP when played. However, only the shield can be triggered again (when an attack is made) while the card is in the active area.<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Ability Card Reveal</b></font><br/><br/><b>If my leading card is revealed at the start of a round, when exactly is my second card revealed?</b><br/>They are both revealed at the start of the round, just put your leading card on top. Once everyone has chosen their cards and revealed them, both of each player's cards are open information.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Advantage/Disadvantage</b></font><br/><br/><b>If I have advantage or disadvantage, how do I determine whether one attack modifier card is better or worse in the case of effects on the card beyond the typical +/- modifiers? How do I know when a comparison of the cards is mathematically ambiguous?</b><br/>All effects listed on the card (negative conditions, elements, healing, etc.) have a positive but undefined value. Note that only the values and effects as listed on the cards and the attack's value (used for the 2x modifier) are considered when doing a comparison. This includes any listed bonuses on the cards that are in effect for the attack, such as from a performed elemental consumption. No other game effects or conditions should be considered (like poison, wound or item effects). Thus, these would be the rulings in the following cases:<br/><br/><pre>  </pre>2x and Attack 2 vs +2: Ambiguous (2 x 2 = 2 + 2)<br/><pre>  </pre>2x and Attack 2 vs +1: 2x is better (2 x 2 &gt; 2 + 1)<br/><pre>  </pre>2x and Attack 1 + 1 from consumption vs +1: 2x is better (2 x 2 &gt; 2 + 1)<br/><pre>  </pre>+1 vs +2: +2 is better<br/><pre>  </pre>+1 Stun vs +1: +1 Stun is better<br/><pre>  </pre>+0 Stun vs +2: Ambiguous<br/><pre>  </pre>+1 Stun vs +1 Fire: Ambiguous<br/><pre>  </pre>+0 Muddle vs +2 Stun: Ambiguous<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Allies</b></font><br/><br/><b>Am I an ally of myself?</b><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>Do allied monsters count towards battle goals or personal goals?</b><br/>No<br/><br/><b>Do allied monsters drop loot?</b><br/>No<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Ambiguous or Tied Situations</b></font><br/><br/><b>In cases of ambiguity where players decide the outcome, how should the players decide? Should they do what is best for themselves or worst for themselves?<br/></b>It is up to you. That is why you are deciding. It is assumed that you would decide whatever is best for you, but, again, it is up to you. Note that ambiguity with respect to attack modifier cards drawn for advantage/disadvantage are not decided by the players - the rule book states how to resolve that (use the first drawn card).<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Attack Modifier Cards</b></font><br/><br/><b>Is there any difference between an attack effect (elemental infusion, negative condition, etc.) caused by attack modifier, an item card, or one printed on the ability card itself?</b><br/>No, whether an attack effect is added by a modifier card, an item card or the ability card itself, it functions exactly the same.<br/><br/><b>Is it ever possible to do damage with an attack after the "no damage" attack modifier card or Curse card takes effect?</b><br/>No. If this card is applied to your attack, you do no attack damage with the attack under any circumstances. Note that additional effects, including non-attack damage ones, still take place.<br/><br/><b>What damaging effects are modified by attack modifier cards?</b><br/>Only attacks (specified by the "Attack" keyword) are modified by attack modifier cards. Traps, hazardous terrain, retaliate, wound, and any "suffer X damage" text do not cause attack modifier cards to be drawn. <br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Battle Goals</b></font><br/><br/><b>Does becoming exhausted from lack of cards affect my hit points in any way for the purposes of the "Fast Healer" and "Masochist" battle goals?</b><br/>No, you can still achieve those battle goals after being exhausted if your hit points were in the correct range when you were exhausted.<br/><br/><b>Do allied monsters count towards battle goals?</b><br/>No<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Scenario Setup</b></font><br/><br/><b>What is the exact order of my choices at the beginning of a scenario in terms of battle goals, ability cards, and equipped items?</b><br/>The first thing you should do when starting a scenario (after going through a Road Event when applicable), is look in the scenario book to get the map tiles set up, all the monsters you will be fighting prepared, and apply any scenario effects. Next, you should deal battle goals and choose one. After choosing your battle goals, then you can decided which items you would like to equip from the ones you own (adding in -1 cards to you attack modifier deck when applicable) and which ability cards you would like to start with from the pool of those you have available to you.<br/><br/><b>What exactly do you place on the map when you first setup a scenario?</b><br/>When setting up, you place all the map tiles, all the doors, all corridor tiles, all the story point markers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and all objective tokens (a, b, c, etc.) and reveal the first room. When you reveal a room, you place everything in it.<br/><br/><b>What is open information and what is hidden information to the party when setting up the map for a scenario?</b><br/>The intent and recommendation is that you try to only look at the contents of the first room (except for doors, story point markers and objective tokens). However, since all the contents of the map had to be fully displayed in the scenario book, it is technically open information. Obviously the scenario will be easier if you choose to examine all the contents before hand.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Components and Icons</b></font><br/><br/><b>I know that if I run out of standees for a monster, no more are placed, but what if I run out of bases?</b><br/>Try to find a suitable replacement. Standee bases shouldn't limit monster numbers.<br/><br/><b>What is the red starburst symbol next to traps on the monster cards from the random dungeon deck?</b><br/>This symbol indicates the trap is a damage trap.<br/><br/><b>What happens if I run out of condition tokens?</b><br/>Condition tokens are not meant to limit the total usage of the condition (unlike Curse and Bless). Use another token or make a note to keep track.<br/><br/><b>[R1 Errata] What's up with side B of map tiles L and D, they don't line up with the scenario book and the random dungeon deck?</b><br/>Those are misprints. The "b" sides of the "L" and "D" tiles are misprinted and have their art rotated by 180 degrees in relation to their puzzle piece connections when compared to the images in the scenario book and random dungeon deck. When setting up these tiles, make sure their puzzle connection orientation is correct and don't use the art as a reference.<br/><br/><b>There aren't enough scenario aid tokens to cover all the icons used in some scenarios, what's up with that?</b><br/>The set of scenario aid tokens is not strictly meant to cover all the icons in every scenario. If necessary, use other markers as an alternative.<br/><br/><b>[R1 Errata] What do I use the Curse and Bless tokens for?</b><br/>The Bless and Curse tokens were included in error and are not used<br/><br/><b>[R1 Errata] Where is the small envelop with a sun Icon shown in the picture of the rulebook?</b><br/>It doesn't exist. It shouldn't be included in the picture.<br/><br/><b>My damage counters, monster standees and sealed envelope count doesn't match the list in the rule-book. Am I missing items?</b><br/><br/>[R1 Errata] The component list in the front of the rule book should say there are 28 "1" damage counters, 240 monster standees and 3 sealed envelopes.<br/><br/>[R2+ Errata] The component list should say 236 monster standees. Note that 4 standees were removed from R1.<br/><br/>If you are missing items, you can get replacements here: <a target='_blank' href="http://www.cephalofair.com/contact" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">www.cephalofair.com/contact</a><br/><br/><b>Is the curse deck shared between players and monsters?</b><br/>[R1 Errata] No. The curse deck should be split into two equal decks of 10 cards each (Rev 2 has symbols on the cards denoting this).<br/><br/>One deck is exclusively for putting curse cards into the player's attack modifier decks, and the other is exclusively for putting curse cards into the monster's attack modifier deck. So no single attack modifier deck can ever have more than 10 curse cards in it. When a curse card is removed from a player’s attack modifier deck, it is returned to the player curse card deck, and a curse card removed from the monster attack modifier deck is returned to the monster curse card deck. If curses are distributed at the beginning of a scenario, distribute them as evenly as possible to all those affected, with players deciding cases of ambiguity.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Damage</b></font><br/><br/><b>Does overkill damage (damage past 0 HP) count for abilities that depend on the amount of damage "inflicted" or "suffered"?</b><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Doors and Doorways</b></font><br/><br/><b>If you are standing in a doorway between two rooms, are you considered within both rooms, within neither room, or you choose one? What if the doorway is between two tiles?</b><br/>You are in a doorway - you are in neither room nor tile. Note that if two tiles are connected by a corridor token, it is considered one large room but you are still in neither tile.<br/><br/><b>If a monster drops a coin on a doorway and then the door closes, what happens to the coin?</b><br/>The coin is removed from the board.<br/><br/><b>What happens if a monster is on a doorway and the door closes?</b><br/>The monster suffers trap damage and is then placed in the nearest unoccupied hex (players decide ties).<br/><br/><b>Does each door token of a double door have to be opened one at a time?</b><br/>Yes<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Exhaustion</b></font><br/><br/><b>Should curses and blesses be removed from a player's modifier deck immediately when becoming exhausted so that other players and monsters can use them?</b><br/>As per the rules, they are not removed until the end of the scenario.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Initiative</b></font><br/><br/><b>If a character has initiative 99 and another is doing a long rest (which is treated as initiative 99), which one goes first in the round?</b><br/>The character doing the long rest goes later.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Item Use</b></font><br/><br/><b>What exactly is considered using an item for the purposes of battle goals?</b><br/>Any instance of you applying the effects of an item card to a situation is considered a use.<br/><br/><b>When exactly can I use an item? Can I use it in the middle of a movement or other ability? Can I use items outside of my turn?</b><br/>Items are only used during your turn unless it is used as a reaction to an enemy  (as per its wording) or during a granted out-of-turn ability if the ability matches the item's restrictions. Note that wording like "add +X to the entire attack action" on an item expands the item's scope - it isn't a restriction that the item can only be used during full actions.<br/><br/>During your turn you can use an item at any time, including but not limited to: during a movement, after consuming an element and gaining its effects during attack resolution, between attacks of multi-target/AoE attack action, or after you have taken all your actions - with the following restrictions:<br/><pre>  - </pre>Must meet all restrictions listed on the card<br/><pre>  - </pre>If an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage or disadvantage), it has to be used before an attack modifier is drawn<br/><pre>  - </pre>If an item grants an action, it cannot be used in the middle of another action<br/><pre>  - </pre>An item cannot be used before/during "start of turn" effects nor after/during "end of turn" effects. Note that if an item (or other effect) grants an extra action "at the end of your turn", that effectively extends the turn so items can be used during that extra action.<br/><br/><b>Is there any limitation to the number of items I can use on my turn or even during the same ability?</b><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>When do equipped items become active?</b><br/>Equipped items are active from the beginning of the scenario, such that if an item reacts to an enemy's actions, it does so immediately.<br/><br/><b>Is the use of an item card mandatory?</b><br/>The use of items with charges is mandatory if it's conditions are met<br/>The use of items with passive effects is mandatory.<br/>All other uses of items are optional<br/><br/>Item cards with circles to track multiple uses act exactly like persistent ability cards, in that if the situation applies, you must use the item in reaction and lose a charge. Additionally, it should be noted that if the card has a spent icon in the lower right corner, it is not technically spent until all charges have been lost, and so cannot be refreshed through resting or other abilities until all charges have been used.<br/><br/><b>How do I use an item that says "Heal X" (R1)?</b><br/>If an item says "Heal X damage," it is functionally equivalent to a "Heal X, Self" action. It interacts with wound and poison like any other heal ability.<br/><br/><b>If an item says it is used on the next "source of damage", does that include when the damage is 0?</b><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>If you have one item that prevents the use of another (like an item A that can only be used on a single target attack and another item B that adds a target to the attack), can you play both items by playing A first?</b><br/>Yes. You can play items in what ever order you chose as long as their conditions are met <u>at the time</u> you play them.<br/><br/><b>If an item states its effect applies to a single attack and that attack is then turned into a multi-target attack, does the item's effect apply to the extra new attacks?</b><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>If a modifier card allows you to refresh an item, can you refresh an item that is used in the middle of the attack or must the item have been used before the attack began?</b><br/>You can refresh an item that was (or will be) used during the attack. Note that the rule that you can't use an item that affects an attack AFTER the modifier card is drawn still applies.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Kill Credit</b></font><br/><br/><b>If an enemy dies from trap damage, who gets credit for the kill?</b><br/>The credit goes to whomever causes the trap to be sprung, not whomever made it. If the enemy moves onto a trap on its own, no one would get the credit.<br/><br/><b>If an enemy dies from WOUND, who gets credit for the kill?</b><br/>No one.<br/><br/><b>Who gets credit for a mind controlled monster's kills?</b><br/>No one<br/><br/><b>Who gets credit for a mind controlled ally's kills?</b><br/>The ally<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Line of Sight, Adjacency and Walls</b></font><br/><br/><b>What blocks Line of sight?</b><br/>Walls and closed doors are the only things that block Line of Sight<br/><br/><b>What are the line-of-sight rules?</b><br/>Line-of-sight is necessary for all attacks (including every hex of an area attack) and all other abilities that specify a range (including looting, which technically has a range). Any non-attack ability that does not specify a range does not require line-of-sight.<br/><br/><b>Are there any adjacency restrictions on what I can target with a melee area attack (area attack containing a grey hex)?</b><br/>The only restriction is that you have to have line of sight on a figure to target it with an attack. Other than that, if the hex is in the configuration shown on the card, you can attack it.<br/><br/><b>What exactly is considered a wall?</b><br/>The edge of any map tile and the entire area of any partial hex along the edge are considered walls unless they are covered by a corridor tile. Doors are also considered walls when they are closed. Where the edge of a complete hex on a map tile comes up right to the edge of the tile, there is a dark border to remind you that a wall exists at that edge, though it does not technically begin (for cases of line-of-sight) until the edge. If two map tiles are set next to each other such that these dark edges line up (i.e. the border of the first and second room of the first scenario), the wall is considered to still be there as a one-dimensional line.<br/><br/><b>If an enemy is on the other side of this one-dimensional wall line from me, can I hit him with a melee attack?</b><br/>Not with a non-AoE melee attack. All range, even range 1 melee attacks, can't be counted through walls. In fact, for all intents and purposes (including looting), these two hexes are not adjacent and considered two hexes apart. Note that AoE Melee attacks use their diagram (not adjancency) to determine if a target is in range. The following image shows the range in green (range 3) between a source and a target. The blue line shows their LOS.<br/><div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4517063"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/tXH7kIOrWIV4cDwLxGqtNQJOCOo=/fit-in/200x150/pic4517063.jpg" border=0></a></div><br/><br/><b>Do the corners and edges of walls block LOS?</b><br/>Yes, if the sight line touches any corner or edge of a wall, or any corner or edge of a hex that is considered a wall, LOS is blocked.<br/><br/><b>How does LOS work with destructible walls?</b><br/>A destructible wall hex does not block LOS to itself. However, corners shared with other walls do block LOS to the wall hex. So a destructible wall cannot be targeted until at least one of its corners does not touch another wall and you have LOS to that corner.<br/><br/><b>If a figure is flying on top of something (like an obstacle), are they considered adjacent to it?</b><br/>No<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Obstacles</b></font><br/><br/><b>Are obstacles with hit points considered enemies? Can they be poisoned, wounded, etc.?</b><br/>Obstacles with hit points are technically considered enemies for most ability purposes, but they are immune to all negative conditions, to force move abilities (like push/pull/teleport) and some special character specific abilities (see character specific FAQ entries)<br/><br/><b>Per the rules, obstacles cannot be placed if they block off an area of the map. How does this work with doors that may be opened in a future turn?</b><br/>You may not block off a closed door unless there is an open path to the other side of it.<br/><br/><b>What about scenarios where parts of the map are blocked off from the start or become blocked off during play due to scenario instructions?</b><br/>Treat each isolated section of the map separately for the purposes of this rule.<br/><br/><b>Are you allowed to create obstacles next to an area consisting only of obstacles (ex: several obstacles up against a wall)?</b><br/>Yes, as long as you don't block off an open area.<br/><br/><b>Can you destroy or move an obstacle inside a group of existing obstacles if it creates a blocked-off area?</b><br/>No<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Open Information</b></font><br/><br/><b>Can I say X or Y at the beginning of the round when choosing my cards?</b><br/>As long as you avoid specific numerical values and card titles, you can say whatever you want.<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Puzzle Pieces</b></font><br/><b>What are these puzzle piece references I keep seeing?</b><br/>Not sure, but I found a strange piece of a puzzle...<br/><div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4056375"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/oup5aVmvJZG8vifqh3-OdPE4ZC8=/fit-in/200x150/pic4056375.png" border=0></a></div><br/>#GloomhavenNumberOneCelebrationMarch31<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Resting</b></font><br/><br/><b>When I do a long rest, when do the effects (healing, getting your discards back, refreshing spent items) take place?</b><br/>The effects from a long rest occur during your turn on initiative 99.<br/><br/><b>If I have zero cards in my hand and two cards in my discard, can I still long rest even though I will become exhausted at the beginning of the next round?</b><br/>Absolutely. You can stick around for one more round as a meat shield. Also consider the following question.<br/><br/><b>If I long rest, do my summons still get a turn during the round?</b><br/>Yes, they will act directly before your turn on initiative 99.<br/><br/><b>If I long rest, do I still technically have a turn for the round?</b><br/>Yes, on initiative 99, you perform the effects of the long rest, and it is considered a turn, so you can still use items or do other things you would normally be able to do on your turn (unless you are stunned, in which case you are only allowed to perform the effects of the long rest).<br/><br/><b>Can you do a short rest in the last round of a scenario?</b><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>Does a long rest cure WOUND and POISON? Does drinking a potion cure WOUND and POISON?</b><br/>Yes, these are both considered "Heal" effects and thus interact with WOUND and POISON like other "Heal" abilities. Note that the WOUND damage would happen before the effects of the long rest, so you would still take a damage before it was cured.<br/><br/><b>Can I chose not to receive the heal or refresh items in a Long Rest?</b><br/>Yes. The only thing you have to do in a long rest is lose a card from the discard pile and put the rest back into your hand.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Revealing Rooms</b></font><br/><br/><b>If a character becomes exhausted, and then I open a door to a new room, does the room populate based on the non-exhausted player count, or the original player count?</b><br/>The player count that you started the scenario with.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Round Tracker</b></font><br/><br/><b>What is the round tracker for? Do I need to complete all scenarios within 12 turns?</b><br/>No, the round tracker is only for specific scenarios. Unless the scenario has a specific reason for having you track rounds, don't worry about it.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Scenario Completion</b></font><br/><br/><b>What happens if we meet the scenario's goals but then the entire party gets exhausted during the round?</b><br/>You lose the scenario<br/><br/><b>If a scenario is successfully completed, is there any penalty for being exhausted?</b><br/>No, you earn everything that you would have earned if you hadn't become exhausted: completed battle goals, tallied money and experience, bonus completion experience, any rewards in the scenario book granted for completing the scenario like bonus gold or experience.<br/><br/><b>Do I regain all my hit points once a scenario is finished?</b><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>Do BLESS and CURSE cards stay in my deck once a scenario is over?</b><br/>No, Curse and Bless cards (including those purchased from the Sanctuary) and any -1 cards with a star in the corner should be removed from your deck at the end of a scenario.<br/><br/><b>Is it possible to prematurely fail a scenario to avoid death or wasting time?</b><br/>Not technically, no, but if there are no monsters on the board and no more will be placed on the board without player action, then all players would be free to play out however many rounds it takes to exhaust themselves without danger. If all players agree, you can save yourself the time and call the scenario failed early.<br/><br/><b>If we fail a scenario, can we immediately retry it?</b><br/>Yes, your party location is still considered to be at that scenario, so you can fully recover hit points, cards, etc. and immediately do the scenario again without doing a road event, or you can return to town or do another scenario, but that may necessitate a road event before starting a scenario depending on the linking rules.<br/><br/><b>Do I get the money and treasure tiles left on the ground when I finish a scenario?</b><br/>No, all loot left on the ground is lost once the scenario is over. You have to pick it up during the scenario. If you want the treasure tiles that you weren't able to pick up, you will have to play through the scenario again.<br/><br/><b>Do I have to win a scenario to complete it?</b><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Traps and Hazardous Terrain</b></font><br/><br/><b>If I end my turn on a hex with hazardous terrain, do I take any additional damage?</b><br/>No, you only take damage when you enter the hex.<br/><br/><b>Can I or one of my allies spring a trap that I lay? Can monsters spring their own traps?</b><br/>Yes, traps have no memory once you place them. They become hazards for everyone.<br/><br/><b>If I lay a trap on an open door, and then the door closes because of a scenario rule, what happens to the trap?</b><br/>It is removed from the board.<br/><br/><b>Are abilities that force move an enemy one or more hexes (Push/Pull and abilities that say "force move") affected by difficult terrain</b><br/>No<br/><br/><b>What happens if a figure loses flying on top of a trap, hazardous terrain or terrain with special effects?</b><br/>The trap or effect is triggered.<br/><br/><b>Do traps placed my monsters scale with the scenario level?</b><br/>No<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Turn Scope</b></font><br/><br/><b>What exactly is the timing of a figure’s turn?</b><br/>A figure’s turn starts when the previous figure ends their turn and ends when the next figure begins theirs.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Unoccupied vs. Empty Hex</b></font><br/><br/><b>Can you explain the difference between an unoccupied hex and an empty hex?</b><br/>An unoccupied hex has no figures (monsters, characters or character summons) present. An empty hex has no figures, tokens (money or otherwise), or overlay tiles present except corridors, open doors, pressure plates and scenario aid tokens.<br/><br/><br/><b>Player Abilities</b><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Action, Attack Action, Attack, Attack Ability, Attack Effects, Targeted</b></font><br/><br/><b>What do those terms mean?</b><br/>An <b>action</b> is the top half or bottom half of an ability card, or an item or persistent ability that specifically says it grants an "action". An out-of-turn ability (like move or attack) granted by another figure's ability is not an action unless the granting ability says "action".<br/><br/>An <b>attack action</b> is an action in which an attack is performed. It constitutes any and all attacks made with that specific action. If none of the attack abilities of an action are performed, it is not an attack action.<br/><br/>An ability is considered an <b>attack ability</b> if it has the word "attack" printed on the card.<br/><br/>An <b>attack</b> is a single attack on a single target that flips over a single attack modifier card. If your attack action is, say, "Attack 3," then there is only one attack in your attack action. If it is "Attack 2, Target 3," then your attack action consists of three separate attacks. If the action contains separate "attack" lines, all are part of the attack action. If the attack is an AoE, all attacks performed as part of the AoE are part of the attack action.<br/><br/>An <b>attack effect</b> is an effect attached to the attack. It is applied either during damage resolution or after the attack (see list below). If it happens after the attack, it is applied even if the attack does no damage, including due to the NULL or Curse cards. You must choose whether you will do an effect to an attack before you draw a modifier card. Some modifier cards have their own attack effects and you can choose to apply them after you draw if they qualify as optional effects. Attack effects except Add Target are applied before retaliate (Add Target grants a brand new attack and one attack must be resolved completely before another is performed). Some attacks have Abilities (like Heal) that aren't attack effects but that are still attached to the attack. These abilities are applied after the attack is completely resolved (after retaliate).<br/><br/>Attack Effects:<br/><pre>   </pre>- +X (during damage resolution)<br/><pre>   </pre>- Pierce (during damage resolution)<br/><pre>   </pre>- Add Target (after the attack)<br/><pre>   </pre>- Push/Pull (after attack)<br/><pre>   </pre>- Conditions (after attack)<br/><pre>   </pre>- Infusions (after attack)<br/><pre>   </pre>- Conditional statements written in small font below the attack, like Cragheart's Heaving Swing (after attack)<br/><br/>An ability is considered <b>targeted</b> only if it says “Target” or “Attack”<br/><br/><b>If an ability allows me to "kill" an enemy, is that considered an attack?</b><br/>No, unless the ability says "attack," it is not an attack.<br/><br/><b>What if I consume an element to turn an attack action into a kill action?</b><br/>So long as you consume the element and trigger only the kill effect, the word "instead" negates the attack, and it is no longer an attack.<br/><br/><b>If I kill an enemy with my attack damage, can I still apply the effects of the attack on that enemy (i.e., curse, push, etc.)?</b><br/>No, added attack effects are always applied after the damage. If you kill an enemy with the damage, then it is no longer around to be pushed onto a trap or cursed.<br/><br/><b>Are abilities that target a single figure with an attack but damage additional figures via other non-attack effects (like suffer damage) still considered single target attacks?</b><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>Are multi-target attacks where there is only one current valid target or if there are current conditions that limit the attack to only one target considered single-target attacks?</b><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>What exactly is considered a single-target Attack Action?</b><br/>Any action in which only a single target could be attacked. This excludes actions with multiple separate attack abilities.<br/><br/><b>Are the same differentiations used when mitigating "damage from an attack" versus a "source of damage?"</b><br/>Yes, when something reduces damage from an attack (namely, Shield), it is specifically referring to a figure making an "Attack" and flipping over an attack modifier card. If you are reducing or negating a "source of damage," that can be anything: attacks, traps, hazardous terrain, retaliate, wound, suffering damage from choosing a different card to lose when short resting, or any other "suffer X damage" text.<br/><br/><b>When do the effects of deaths (like moving Dooms) occur: immediately after the figure dies or after the action completes?</b><br/>Effects of death occur immediately after the figure dies<br/><br/><b>If an Attack has an attached element consumption that grants an effect plus XP (ex: Consume Ice, Stun 1 XP) can you skip the effect and still get the XP? What if the monster dies as part of the Attack?</b><br/>Before you attempt the attack, you chose whether to do the consumption as part of the attack. If you do, you also chose if you want to include the effect as part of the consumption. If you decide to consume the element, you will gain the XP (it is mandatory), even if the monster dies or you decided not to include the Stun.<br/><br/><b>If you choose to discard a card during your turn without using it as an action (basic or otherwise), it is still considered an action?</b><br/>No<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Granting Abilities/Actions</b></font><br/><br/><b>Is an ability that grants another figure an out-of-turn ability (like move or attack) considered an action for the recipient?</b><br/>Only if the ability says "action"<br/><br/><b>Can figures without attacks be granted Attacks from ability cards and if so, which attack deck do they use?</b><br/>Yes. They use the granting player's attack deck just for the duration of that attack.<br/><br/><b>Can a character doing a long rest be granted an action - like from an ability or an item?</b><br/>Yes<br/><br/><b>Can you use an ability that grants a figure an immediate attack if the figure has no current valid targets just to gain XP from the ability?</b><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>If a summon has a "-" for its move or attack, can I grant it move or attack actions, respectively?</b><br/>It depends. The "-" means that it has no base for that stat. So you can't grant an "Attack +2" action to a summon with a "-", as that is a modifier to an undefined base, but you can grant it an "Attack 2" action, as that sets the base. The same applies to movement. Also note that summons (or monsters) with "-" movement can still be pushed and pulled.<br/><br/><b>If a summon/ally is granted an Attack X, which of it's base effects does it get to use? Does it keep its range?</b><br/>Attack X replaces the figure's base ability so it is a melee attack unless a Range +X is specified or otherwise noted. Other effects from the Stat card (like poison, multiple targets, etc.) are retained.<br/><br/><b>Can a figure still perform actions prevented by disarm, immobilize and stun even if those actions are granted to the figure outside their turn?</b><br/>[Errata] No. The “on their turn” phrase listed in the condition section of the rule book should not be there.<br/><br/><b>If an ability optionally grants an ally an action/ability ("may move", "may heal", etc.), who chooses if the ally performs the ability/action if it is granted to an NPC or summons?</b><br/>If granted to an NPC, the caster choses whether the NPC will do the ability. If granted to a summons, the owner of the summons choses.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Area of Effect Attacks</b></font><br/><br/><b>Can I hit my allies with area attacks?</b><br/>No, unless the action specifically states that you do. An area effect ability shows you the hexes that you can target with an attack, and you cannot target allies with attacks under any circumstances, so, in general, allies are safe from your abilities. Certain classes (the Cragheart, for example), however, have abilities that specifically state that allies in certain situations suffer damage or gain negative conditions, but these cases are clearly stated on the ability cards.<br/><br/><b>Can I target empty hexes with an area attack?</b><br/>While you are not technically "targeting" the empty hex, the hex of an area attack that is within the range specified by the attack can be empty so long as there are enemies in the attack area that are in your line-of-sight.<br/><br/><b>Can I target a wall hex with a ranged AoE attack?</b><br/>No, but the AoE pattern can overlap a wall hex as long as it isn't the initial target hex.<br/><br/><b>If my area of effect for an attack is chiral (not equal to its mirror image) can I use the mirror image of the area instead?</b><br/>Yes, in addition to applying any rotation to an area of effect, you can also use the mirror image of the area.<br/><br/><b>When is LOS evaluated for each attack in an AoE, all at once before the 1st attack or as each attack is performed?</b><br/>Evaluate LOS for each attack when that specific attack is resolved<br/><br/><b>Can you change the placement/rotation of the AoE pattern after resolving one of the attacks?</b><br/>No. You must decide the AoE pattern placement and rotation before resolving the 1st attack<br/><br/><b>Are Melee AoE attacks that have hexes that aren't adjacent to the attacker still considered Range 1?</b><br/>Yes. So when using Add Target with a Melee AoE attack, the new target must be at range 1.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Add Target</b></font><br/><br/><b>If the attack has targeting or range restrictions, do they still apply to the new target?</b><br/>Yes. This includes "exactly at range" restrictions, restrictions that state an effect must exist on the target to be attacked or any other targeting qualifiers specified for the attack.<br/><br/><b>How does Add Target interact with area attacks?</b><br/>Add Target always adds a single extra target within the range of your attack to the attack, and this target cannot be an enemy already targeted by the attack (a single attack ability cannot target the same enemy multiple times). So if you got an Add Target effect on an area attack, you could pick one enemy within range but outside of the area (because all enemies in the area are already getting attacked) to get hit by the attack as well. All conditions and other effects of the attack (other than effects that would add additional attack targets) would apply to the added target, as well. Each instance of the Add Target effect adds an additional target to the attack using the above guidelines. Add Target DOES NOT add a hex to the area so effects that apply to the "Area" don't apply to the Add Target.<br/><br/>Note that if an attack ability targets everything within a specified range, Add Target would do nothing since you are already targeting everything in that range.<br/><br/><b>Can you perform an Add Target effect and not attack anything?</b><br/>No. If you chose to perform the Add Target, you have to attack something<br/><br/><b>If you gain Add Target for a single target attack that grants XP if the target meets a specific criteria (example: Scoundrel's Single Out), do you gain the XP for the new additional target if it meets the criteria?</b><br/>Yes<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Target X</b></font><br/><br/><b>For the Target X ability, can you choose to attack less than X targets?</b><br/>Yes<br/><br/><b>Can you perform a Target X ability and not attack anything?</b><br/>No. If you chose to perform the Target X ability, you have to attack something.<br/><br/><b>How does Target X interact with area attacks?</b><br/>This is handled the same as Add Target, except the figure gains X-1 targets that all must be outside the AoE.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Conditions</b></font><br/><br/><b>If a condition lasts until the end of my next turn, what exactly does "next turn" mean?</b><br/>"Next turn" means your next full turn. So if you start a turn with the condition in effect, then at the end of that turn, it is removed. If a monster stuns you on its turn, then your next turn (whether that happens in the current round or the following round) you would be under the effect of stun, and then it would go away at the end of that turn. If you manage to get stunned on your own turn, you would immediately suffer the effects, then you would also suffer from the effects on your following turn in the following round before the effect wore off at the end of that turn. This also applies to conditions on monsters.<br/><br/><b>If I apply POISON with my attack, does it immediately give me +1 on the attack?</b><br/>No. All added effects of an attack are only applied after the amount of damage is resolved. The one exception to this is PIERCE, which is applied at the same time as the damage.<br/><br/><b>If I have both the WOUND and POISON conditions and am healed, what happens?</b><br/>Both conditions are removed and no actual healing takes place.<br/><br/><b>Can I voluntarily end positive conditions on myself like Strengthen and Invisible?</b><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>If I get stunned before I have a chance to play my cards for the round, do I have to discard them, or can I take them back and do a long rest?</b><br/>You have to discard them.<br/><br/><b>Can a figure still perform actions prevented by disarm, immobilize and stun even if those actions are granted to the figure outside their turn?</b><br/>[Errata] No. The “on their turn” phrase listed in the condition section of the rule book should not be there.<br/><br/><b>How does stun work with persistent effects and passive items?</b><br/>Stun does not affect them, they function normally. Passive Items are those whose effects trigger automatically when their requirements are met or whose effect take place immediately on scenario start (Iron Helmet, Hide Armor, Cloak of Pockets)<br/><br/><b>What happens when a figure becomes immune to a condition that it already has?</b><br/>The condition is removed. Note this does not apply to Curse and Bless. Those immunities prevent the card from entering the modifier deck; they do not prevent existing curse/bless cards from being drawn and applying their effect.<br/><br/><b>What happens if a figure is immobilized or stunned and they are pushed/ pulled?</b><br/>The push/pull can be applied to an immobilized or stunned enemy - the enemy isn't using its limbs to move, it is being pushed/pulled.<br/><br/><b>Can you clarify how gaining multiple conditions of the same type is handled?</b><br/>As per the rule book, you can't have multiple conditions of the same type on a figure. When a figure gains an existing condition a second time, the new instance replaces the old instance, resetting the expiration turn. Note that curse and bless are not assigned to a figure, they are added to a modifier deck (which affects any figure that draws from it) and as per the rules, multiple curse/bless cards can be added to the deck.<br/><br/><b>What specific abilities are prevented by invisibility?</b><br/>Only targeted abilities from enemies (those that say "Target" or "Attack") are prevented by invisibility.<br/><br/><b>What happens when a figure without an attack deck (like some NPC's) gets hit with Curse or Bless?</b><br/>Nothing. Note that Summons do have an assigned attack deck (the summoning player's).<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Elements</b></font><br/><br/><b>If I consume an element in the strong column, does it go down to waning or all the way down to inert?</b><br/>Whenever an element is consumed, it always moves down to inert, no matter where it started.<br/><br/><b>Can you explain the timing of elemental infusions?</b><br/>Yes, the main take-away here is that any elements you create on your turn from any source (abilities or items) do not get moved to the strong column until the end of your turn. This means that you cannot create an element (that wasn't already present) and then consume it on the same turn because it won't be available to be consumed until the end of your turn. On the up side, this also means that if an element is already strong or waning at the start of your turn, you can create the element again with your first action, consume the existing element with your second action, and then the element will still go up to strong at the end of your turn even though you just used it.<br/><br/><b>If an element consumption is attached to an attack ability, when can I chose to consume the element?</b><br/>Before any attack of the ability, affecting all subsequent attacks of that ability.<br/><br/><b>If an element consumption is attached to a move, when can I chose to consume the element?</b><br/>The element can be consumed at any time during the movement - so before you start moving, after you move some spaces or after you move all spaces.<br/><br/><b>When do you chose which actual element is infused for multi-color element abilities?</b><br/>At the end of the turn, when the element is actually infused.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Experience</b></font><br/><br/><b>Can I play a card just for the experience?</b><br/>You have to perform at least one part of the action on the card to gain the experience. If it just says "Attack," you have to attack an enemy to get the experience. If it has "Attack" and "Move," however, you can just move and not attack and still get the experience. A larger experience symbol (as opposed to a small one) is not meant to be tied to any specific ability in the action.<br/><br/><b>Can I choose not to gain the experience from using an action?</b><br/>No, experience is not optional.<br/><br/><b>If I am level 9, can I still earn experience?</b><br/>You can still track experience when you are level 9 as a metric for how well you are doing in the scenario, but experience no longer gives you any long-term benefits.<br/><br/><b>When a multi target attack has a Gain XP effect, do I get XP for each target?</b><br/>Only if the card specifically says so.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Heal</b></font><br/><br/><b>If a heal or other beneficial ability specifies a range, can I affect myself?</b><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>How do the heal rolling modifier cards work?</b><br/>Any time a "Heal" attack modifier card is resolved, the figure who flipped it heals the amount specified. This heal can remove wound and poison like any other heal.<br/><br/><b>Does a heal from a modifier card turn the action into a "heal action"?</b><br/>Yes<br/><br/><b>If I draw two 'heal self' rolling modifiers in the same attack, is one heal performed or two?</b><br/>Heals from rolling modifiers stack into a single Heal.<br/><br/><b>What happens if a figure is poisoned and a “Heal all” ability is used on it?</b><br/>The heal ability is treated just like other heal abilities, so the poison is removed but no damage is healed.<br/><br/><b>Can you use a heal ability on a figure that is already at full health?</b><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Loot</b></font><br/><br/><b>Can I decide not to loot money or treasure tiles in my hex at the end of my turn?</b><br/>End-of-turn looting is not optional. If there are money or treasure tiles in your hex at the end of your turn, you have to loot them.<br/><br/><b>Can I perform a Loot even if there is no Loot in range?</b><br/>No<br/><br/><b>Are there restrictions on what I can loot with a Loot ability in regards to line-of-sight or obstacles?</b><br/>The specific mechanics are that you can loot all hexes within range X of you, where X refers to "Loot X." This means that if you can target the hex with an attack in that range, you can loot the hex. This means loot is unaffected by monsters or obstacles, but is affected by line-of-sight.<br/><br/><b>If an enemy or scenario effect forces me onto a hex with loot, can I automatically pick it up, like end-of-turn looting?</b><br/>No, end-of-turn looting happens only at the end of your turn. You cannot automatically pick up loot at any other time.<br/><br/><b>If I loot, say, an armor item from a treasure tile and I am already wearing armor, what happens?</b><br/>You can own any number of items (but only one copy of each). It is not limited only to what you can equip. So when you find armor in a chest and already have armor, you still get to keep the armor you got, you just won't be able to equip it until next scenario. Actually, since you can only equip items in between scenarios, even if you weren't wearing armor, you'd still have to wait to equip the armor you just got.<br/><br/><b>What if I loot an item I already had a copy of?</b><br/>In this case, you would immediately gain the sell value of the item you looted, and place that copy of the item in the city's available supply of items if it was not already there.<br/><br/><b>What if I loot an item and there aren't any more copies available?</b><br/>You would immediately gain the sell value of the item.<br/><br/><b>Which treasure tile rewards/penalties affect a single character and which affect all characters?</b><br/>All treasure results (with the following two exceptions) affect only the character that loots the treasure tile. The exceptions are the "Random Side Scenario" reward, which unlocks a new scenario for the entire campaign, and the "Random Item Design" or the "Item Design" reward, which places a set of items in the shop for anyone in the campaign to purchase.<br/><br/><b>If I loot a "goal" treasure tile in a scenario and then go back to do the scenario again, is the treasure tile still looted?</b><br/>No, unlike numbered treasure tiles, "goal" treasure tiles are reset at the end of every scenario and must be looted again.<br/><br/><b>Do allied monsters drop loot?</b><br/>No<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Move</b></font><br/><br/><b>Can you perform a Move X ability but do 0 move?</b><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>Some abilities state movement has to be done in a straight line. What does that mean?</b><br/>It means a straight line of hexes starting with your current location, moving in one direction (no turning around and moving back).<br/><br/><b>How many movement points does it take for the last hex of a jump if it is on difficult terrain?</b><br/>Per the rules, the last hex is treated as normal movement, so it costs 2 movement points.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Push/Pull</b></font><br/><br/><b>Do I have to push or pull the full amount?</b> <br/>Like any added effect, you can choose not to apply it, but if you do, you have to use the full push or pull effect. The only time the full push or pull may not go into effect is if there are obstacles or figures in the way.<br/><br/><b>What if there are multiple blocked and/or unblocked paths?</b><br/>If a figure is being pushed/pulled and there is an unblocked hex, it has to be used. If there are multiple unblocked hexes, the players decide. This is evaluated one hex at a time until the effect is fully resolved or there are no valid hexes for the figure to move into. This rule applies to pushes/pulls done by monsters as well.<br/><br/><b>Can we push/pull enemies through other enemy figures?</b><br/>Yes, but they can't end the movement in the same hex unless entering the hex kills the enemy being pushed/pulled (from say, hazardous terrain).<br/><br/><b>Can we push/pull flying enemies through obstacles and allies?</b><br/>Yes<br/><br/><b>What happens if there are multiple push/pull effects used in the same ability?</b><br/>If multiple push or pull effects are applied with the same ability (due to attack modifier cards), you can choose to apply or not apply the push/pull from the attack modifier card (e.g. if your ability applied a "push 1," and your attack modifier card applied a "push 1," you could decide to push 1 or 2 since they are separate effects). Effects dependant on the push/pull (like Cragheart's Heaving Swing), apply to all pushes caused by the attack, including pushes/pulls from Attack Modifier cards or Items.<br/><br/><b>What does "closer" and "further" mean for push/pull?</b><br/>They are measured by proximity - count the number of hexes between the source and the target, except through walls.<br/><br/><b>Can I target allies with push/pull abilities?</b><br/>No, allies cannot be targeted at all, even if the ability isn't an Attack.<br/><br/><b>Can flying monsters be pushed into traps?</b><br/>They can be pushed into hexes with traps, but doing so will not trigger the traps.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Figure Swap/Teleport</b></font><br/><br/><b>Are swap/teleport abilities vs monsters considered forced movement?</b><br/>Yes<br/><br/><b>Can teleport abilities be used while immobilized?</b><br/>Yes<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Shield and Retaliate</b></font><br/><br/><b>When exactly does retaliate trigger?</b><br/>Retaliate triggers after all effects of an attack have been applied. If the retaliating figure dies from the attack, the retaliate does not trigger because the figure is removed from the board beforehand. If the retaliating figure is pushed out of the range of its retaliate, it also does not trigger. However, if it is pulled into retaliate range, it would trigger.<br/><br/><b>Is retaliation an attack, is it targeted? If I am invisible, can monsters still retaliate against me?</b><br/>Retaliation is not an attack nor is it targeted, so it is unaffected by invisibility. You can still be retaliated against while invisible.<br/><br/><b>If I take one point of damage from an attack and have multiple abilities (from ability cards or items) which give me Shield when taking damage from an attack, do I have to use all of them?</b><br/>No. You can choose which Shield bonus to apply in this case, and once the damage is reduced to zero, it is no longer a source of damage, so any other bonuses do not have to be used.<br/><br/><b>How long do Shield and Retaliate Last?</b><br/>It depends on how you got the ability. Lemi esplain... no there is too mush. Lemi sum up:<br/><br/><pre>  - </pre>If they are on a card with charges, they activate only for the effect that triggers the use of the charge<br/><pre>  - </pre>If they are on a Round Bonus ability card, they are active for the remainder of the round or until you remove the card from the active area<br/><pre>  - </pre>If they are on a Persistent Bonus ability card, they are active until you remove the card from the active area<br/><pre>  - </pre>If they are from attack modifier cards or a regular ability card, they are active for the remainder of the round<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Summons</b></font><br/><br/><b>Do summons perform end-of-turn looting?</b><br/>No, only characters perform end of turn looting.<br/><br/><b>If a summon has a "-" for its move or attack, can I grant it move or attack actions, respectively?</b><br/>It depends. The "-" means that it has no base for that stat. So you can't grant an "Attack +2" action to a summon with a "-", as that is a modifier to an undefined base, but you can grant it an "Attack 2" action, as that sets the base. The same applies to movement. Also note that summons (or monsters) with "-" movement can still be pushed and pulled.<br/><br/><b>If a summon/ally is granted an Attack X, which of it's base effects does it get to use? Does it keep its range?</b><br/>Attack X replaces the figure's base ability so it is a melee attack unless a Range +X is specified or otherwise noted.

Note that the monster will draw another ability card in the next round (when it would actually be able to take a turn).<br/><br/><b>If there are revealed monsters of different types that share the same ability deck (ex: guards) and two monsters have the same standee number, in what order to they activate?</b><br/>Players decide but they should be consistent from round to round. To make it easier, it may be best to activate the monsters one type at a time (using normal activation order rules). Alternately you can do all of the elites of the different types together, then the normals, deciding ties as needed.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Ability Cards</b></font><br/><br/><b>What is considered an Action for a monster?</b><br/>Each separate Ability on a monster's ability card is considered a separate Action, even multiple abilities of the same type - like separate Attack abilities.<br/><br/><b>If a monster ability card doesn't specify an "Attack" or "Move" ability, do they still perform that ability?</b><br/>No. Monsters only do what is written on their card for that round.<br/><br/><b>If a monster has bonuses like "Shield" or "Retaliate" on their ability card, is that active for the whole round?</b><br/>No, bonuses only become active once the monster takes their turn based on the initiative on the ability card. It then lasts until the end of the round, where it will either get shuffled back into the deck or replaced with the next round's ability card.<br/><br/><b>If a monster has bonuses like "Shield" or "Retaliate" on their stat card card, are they always active?</b><br/>Yes, and they are unaffected by Stun.<br/><br/><b>If a monster is granted Retaliate by both an ability card and the Stat card, are they treated as separate effects or summed together and treated as a single effect (like for resolving "on source of damage" effects)</b><br/>They are summed and treated as a single effect.<br/><br/><b>If a monster ability card lists a melee attack (like a melee AoE or “target adjacent enemies” effects without a "range" specified) but the monster stat card specifies a Range X, is the attack melee or ranged?</b><br/>It is melee, the monster ability card takes precedence.<br/><br/><b>If all monsters of a type are destroyed and then new ones are revealed, do you shuffle the monster's ability cards?</b><br/>No. You only shuffle a monster's ability cards if the shuffle symbol is displayed or all cards have already been drawn<br/><br/><b>How do you measure "closest" when resolving abilities like the Archer trap placement or summons that are placed "closest to an enemy"?</b><br/>Closest is measured 1st requiring the fewest <u>normal</u> movement points and then 2nd by proximity (but around walls)<br/><br/><b>When a monster has a non-attack ability that doesn't define a specific target (like "Muddle - Target one adjacent enemy"), who does it target?</b><br/>Normal focusing rules are used to determine the target<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Attacks</b></font><br/><br/><b>Can you clarify how monsters do attacks against multiple targets?</b><br/>Area of Effect, Add Target and Target X attacks are treated exactly like they are for players. Unless otherwise stated by a card, the multiple attacks cannot be done on the same enemy because they all come from the same ability. If a card says that multiple attacks are done on the same enemy (as an exception to the rule), the monster will attack its focus until it's dead/exhausted. <br/><br/>If a monster ability card has multiple attack abilities listed in different lines, they are considered <u>separate</u> abilities and will therefore be used on the same target until its dead or exhausted, after which it will follow the focus rules to find its next target.<br/><br/>[Errata] Note that the wording on Page 31 of the rule book regarding monster multiple attacks should read "If the monster can target multiple figures with a single ability..." instead of the "If the monster has multiple attacks..."<br/><br/><b>After a monster is done moving (or didn't have to move), in what order does the monster perform its attacks against multiple targets?</b><br/>Players decide.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Bosses</b></font><br/><br/><b>Are bosses elites?</b><br/>No, bosses are their own class of monster and are thus unaffected by abilities that target normal or elite monsters. Also note that named monsters specified in the scenario book are their own class of monster as well.<br/><br/><b>When do bosses do their special attacks?</b><br/>Only when their ability card says so.<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Named</b></font><br/><br/><b>If a scenario defines all monsters of a type as "named", are they still considered normal or elite?</b><br/>No - they are now Named monsters<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Conditions</b></font><br/><br/><b>Can you explain in more detail how monsters interact with invisible characters?</b><br/>Invisibility works the same regardless of whether it is an invisible character or an invisible monster. Monsters can't focus on invisible characters, move through them (unless flying or jumping), or target them with any attacks or other targeted abilities (an ability like "CURSE, target all enemies within range," for instance, wouldn't affect the invisible character even if he/she were in range). Monsters essentially treat invisible characters like obstacles, but may occasionally affect them with non-target effects (such as splash damage). Once again, however, an invisible character will never be focused on by a monster.<br/><br/>Invisibility can create an edge-case where a monster is unable to find a focus, either because all of its enemies are invisible, or an invisible character is standing in a door or some other one-hex passageway to prevent a monster from finding any viable path to get within range of an enemy. Blocking a passageway like this doesn't always result in not finding focus. Flying or jumping enemies can ignore the obstacle (invisible character), and ranged enemies may still be able to shoot over it, depending on the value of their range and the positions of the other characters.<br/><br/><b>If a monster is disarmed, will it move as if it has an attack?</b><br/>No, disarm negates all effects of having an attack. A monster will move as though it doesn't have an attack, which means it will just try to get as close as possible to its focus.<br/><br/><b>How are ability bonuses (shield and retaliate) affected by stunning a monster?</b><br/>Note that the bonuses are not simply given by the monster ability card. Monsters would have to perform a "Shield 1" action to gain the Shield 1, so these bonuses only activate if a monster is not stunned on its turn. However, abilities listed in the monster stat card are unaffected by stun as they are continuously available.<br/><br/><b>What happens if a non-stunned monster draws a card that gives it an on-death effect but then gets stunned before it dies?</b><br/>The effect is applied, even if the monster is stunned at the time of their death.<br/><br/><b>If a figure is immune to CURSE, what happens if it draws a CURSE card?</b><br/>The card affects the figure normally (i.e. the figure does no damage). Note that it is only immune to the condition, which is the act of shuffling the CURSE card into the deck.<br/><br/><b>If a monster with a ranged attack is under disadvantage from being adjacent to its focus and is also under disadvantage for another reason (ex: muddle), will it still move to attempt to lose its adjacency disadvantage anyway?</b><br/>No. As per the rules, a monster will only move away from its target to lose disadvantage if moving actually does so.<br/><br/><b>Does curse from a monster ability card stack with curse as a trait from the monster stat card?</b><br/>Yes, 2 curse cards will be added to the target's modifier deck.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Doors</b></font><br/><br/><b>If a door is closed due to specific scenario rules, what happens if revealed monsters are stuck in a room with no enemies to attack?</b><br/>Closed doors behave like walls. The monsters are still revealed, so they would still play a card at the beginning of each round, but, until the door is opened, they wouldn't be able to find a focus, and so would not move or attack and just perform any other abilities on their card, as per the normal rules.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Elements</b></font><br/><br/><b>When a monster's initiative comes up and the monsters consume or infuse an element as part of their ability card, do they each consume/infuse an element as they take their individual turns or do they consume/infuse the element as a group?</b><br/>They consume/infuse the element as a group when the 1st monster takes their turn, with all the currently revealed monsters of that type gaining any benefit. However, if new monsters of that type are later revealed, they would need to consume the element again to gain the benefit (assuming it is available).<br/><br/><b>If a monster's element consumption is attached to another ability (like Attack or Move) and can't perform that ability (ex: disarmed or immobilized), is the element consumed?</b><br/>No. However, if the consumption allows the original ability to take place (like Consume for +1 Range which then puts the attack in range) it means that the monster CAN perform the ability and consumes the element to do so.<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Focus</b></font><br/><br/><b>I'm just confused about focus. Can you explain it?</b><br/>Finding a focus for a monster can be tricky in certain circumstances, but it follows some very basic rules.<br/><br/>First of all, is the monster performing an attack on the ability card it drew? If not, pretend as if it is performing a melee attack (i.e. it wants to be adjacent to an enemy).<br/><br/>Next, find path using the least movement points to get within range (and line-of-sight) to attack an enemy. Note that the monster focuses on a target but the movement path is towards a legal firing/attack position hex (unoccupied, in LOS and in range) - its destination hex. It doesn't matter if the monster can't get to its destination hex with the movement it has, as long as there is a path to eventually get to the hex it will still consider this path the optimal path. The enemy/enemies that are within range (and line-of-sight) at the end of this shortest path are considered the "closest."<br/><br/>Side note on negative hexes (traps or hazardous terrain): negative hexes are considered obstacles when determining this path unless there is no path except through the negative hexes. The path can be ten steps long if the enemy avoids the negative hex and two steps long if it goes through the negative hex, it will still choose the ten-step path as long as it is available. Basically, monsters will move through as few negative hexes as possible.<br/><br/>In the case where the monster can use the same number of movement points to get within range (and line-of-sight) of multiple enemies (either because it starts its turn within range or multiple enemies or through some other situation), proximity (i.e. number of hexes they are away, not counting through walls) is then checked as a tie-breaker for "closest."<br/><br/>Okay, now, if there is only one closest enemy within range at the end of that path, that is the monster's focus. If there are multiple closest enemies within range (and line-of-sight), the focus is the enemy among those tied who has the lower initiative/earliest activation for the round as determined at the beginning of the round.<br/><br/>Note that there may be some cases where a monster can't find a focus at all. In order to obtain focus on an enemy, there must be an unblocked path (no walls, enemies, obstacles) to a hex that it can legally stand in where it could eventually move to and target the enemy. If an enemy can't find a focus, it doesn't move or attack on its turn but it can perform any other abilities written on its card.<br/><br/><b>How exactly does a monster with Jump evaluate its focus/movement path?</b><br/>The monster acts as if it has an infinite jump, just like it normally acts as if it has infinite movement. The monster treats anything that would normally block its movement (obstacles, traps, enemies) as an ally in terms of where it can move to (i.e. they can move through them, but not end their movement in the same hex). Then it follows all the normal movement rules (minimum movement required to get as close to the target hex as possible, thinking that it can move through anything).<br/><br/><b>If a monster has jumping or flying for only one turn (say from an ability card), does it evaluate its focus path assuming it has jumping or flying for just its current turn or for the entire path?</b><br/>The monster assumes it can jump or fly for the entire path (as if it was a permanent ability).<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Mind Control</b></font><br/><br/><b>When a monster is controlled by a character, is it considered an ally or an enemy of other monsters while it is being controlled?</b><br/>It is considered an enemy by other monsters for the duration of the mind control (typically either during the character's turn or during the mind controlled monster's turn, depending on the wording of the ability)<br/><br/><b>Can enemies that do not have a base movement be granted movement abilities from other sources like mind control?</b><br/>Enemies without movement function like summons without movement. If they are granted a "Move X" ability, they can move, but if they are granted a "Move +X" ability, they can't.<br/><br/><b>When a monster is forced to do an Attack X, which of its base effects does it get to use? Does it keep its range?</b><br/>Attack X replaces the figure's base ability so it is a melee attack unless a Range +X is specified or otherwise noted. Other effects from the Stat card (like poison, multiple targets, etc.) are retained.<br/><br/><b>Can you use an ability that allows a figure to perform an immediate attack if the figure has no current valid targets just to gain XP from the ability?</b><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>Which attack modifier deck does a mind controlled monster use?</b><br/>The monster's deck.<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Movement</b></font><br/><br/><b>Will a monster move away from its target if it is adjacent and is performing a ranged attack?</b><br/>Yes, monsters move a minimum amount to maximize their attack, so they will move away to lose disadvantage. If it can't lose disadvantage (i.e. is muddled or does not have enough movement points), it will not attempt to do so.<br/><br/><b>Will a monster move away from its target just to extend its distance (kite)?</b><br/>No. It will only move away to maximize its current attacks.<br/><br/><b>If a monster can't get within range to attack with its movement, will it still move closer?</b><br/>Yes, see the next question for how it will choose it's destination hex.<br/><br/><b>After determining focus, how exactly does a monster chose its destination hex and how does it maximize its attack on its focus and any additional targets?</b><br/>It will determine its final destination hex (the hex where it can attack it's focus) by using the prioritization rules below <u>at the beginning of its turn</u>. The evaluation is first done using the monster's current movement range. If the monster can't reach a hex from which to attack using the movement it has this turn, the rules are re-evaluated assuming infinite movement. Also, the monster uses its current attack when determining its attack/movement options, even if it may have a different (or no) attack when it eventually reaches its destination hex. If there are multiple hexes that meet the criteria, players decide ties.<br/><br/><pre>   </pre>1st - Attack its primary focus, losing/avoiding disadvantage if possible<br/><pre>   </pre>2nd - Attack as many extra targets as possible<br/><pre>   </pre>3rd - If there are still multiple attack locations with an equal number of different extra targets, use the focus rules (least amount of movement points*, then proximity, then initiative) from its starting position to determine which secondary target (in addition to the previous target(s)) should be included in the attack (repeating for a tertiary target, etc.) and select the attack location which includes these targets.<br/><pre>   </pre>4th - Lose disadvantage on the extra targets (all equal priority, players decide ties)<br/><pre>   </pre>5th - Use the least amount of movement points*<br/><br/>*Around walls, obstacles and hazards (if possible) using the normal, jumping and flying movement rules<br/><br/>See this <a  href="https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/234575/gloomhaven-rules-quiz"   >Geek List</a> for various community created examples of monster movement.<br/><br/><b>After selecting a destination hex, which path does a monster use to reach it?</b><br/>The monster will take the shortest path to reach the destination hex. If it can't reach the destination hex this turn, it will take the shortest path which brings it as close as possible to the destination hex. Note that if it can't get closer to the destination hex this turn, it will not move. "Shortest" and "Close" mean the fewest movement points around walls, obstacles and hazards (if possible) using the normal, jumping and flying movement rules.<br/><br/><b>What does a monster do if it kills its target or the target becomes unreachable and it has additional attacks that may used against different targets (like from an "Attack X, Attack X" ability card)?</b><br/>If the target <u>dies</u> from the first attack, the monster will attack another target chosen via the focus prioritization rules. If the target is still alive but is now <u>unreachable</u> (ex: was pushed out of range by the 1st attack), the monster will NOT chose another target. Note that if the ability states that the attacks are performed on the same target, it cannot chose another target even if the original target dies.<br/><br/><b>What happens if a ranged monster becomes disarmed while moving towards its target?</b><br/>It will continue moving along its original movement path towards its original destination hex.<br/><br/><b>What happens if a player removes a summon from the board by moving the active card to the lost pile while a monster is moving towards that summon as its focus?</b><br/>The monster would continue to move to its destination hex and if there was another viable target from that hex, it would attack it.<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Summons</b></font><br/><br/><b>How do you distinguish between summoned enemies and other enemies (since summoned enemies don't drop money tokens)?</b><br/>You can place extra scenario tokens (grey circles) on summoned enemies if you have difficulty keeping track.<br/><br/><b>Do summons die after their summoner die?</b><br/>Summons of monsters stay alive, but summons of player characters will die when the player becomes exhausted.<br/><br/><b>Which attack modifier deck do summons of monsters use?</b><br/>The monster's deck unless otherwise specified by the scenario<br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Monster - Traps</b></font><br/><br/><b>What happens if a flying monster is over a stun trap and another monster attempts to move over that stun trap?</b><br/>A figure cannot end their movement in the same hex as another figure so treat the flying monster as an obstacle when determining the non-flying monster’s movement.<br/><br/><br/><b>Campaign</b><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Casual vs Campaign Mode</b></font><br/><br/><b>How are sanctuary donations, road and city events handled when playing scenarios in casual mode?</b><br/>Sanctuary donations and city events can only be done if the last scenario played was in campaign mode. Road events can only be done if the next scenario is being played in campaign mode.<br/><br/><b>Does playing a scenario in casual mode change the party's location?</b><br/>No. The party remains at their previous location - either at their last campaign mode scenario or Gloomhaven.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Character Unlocks, Leveling Up, Perks, Personal Quests</b></font><br/><b><br/>When I level up, does my experience go back to zero?</b><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>How exactly does my "pool" of ability cards work? What can I add to it when I level up?</b><br/>Your pool of ability cards is the set of cards you can choose to add to your hand when you start a scenario. The cards in your hand are the cards you actually play the scenario with and their number is limited based on the class you are playing. When you are starting out with a level 1 character, your pool consists of all level 1 cards, plus the three "X" cards in your deck as well. All other cards are unavailable to you. When you level up, you can take a single card of your new level or lower from the deck of unavailable cards and add it to your pool. In this manner, a level 9 character will add eight more cards to their pool over the course of leveling up from level 1.<br/><br/><b>If a perk on a character sheet has multiple check boxes next to it, does that mean it requires that number of check marks to unlock it, or that I can acquire that perk for one check that number of times?</b><br/>The second case. If a perk has two check boxes, you can gain that perk twice for one perk allocation each.<br/><br/><b>Does the "Ignore Negative Item Effects" perk apply to any negative effects other than -1 Attack Modifier cards?</b><br/>No. That perk applies solely to -1 Attack Modifier cards.<br/><br/><b>Can I choose not to level up when I have the experience or not gain a perk when I have three check marks?</b><br/>No. If you are in town and you have enough experience to level up, you are forced to do so, and must immediately gain all benefits from leveling up - this includes gaining a perk. [ERRATA] The rulebook should state "MUST" instead of "CAN" for the perk benefit. If you have three check marks, you must immediately gain a perk.<br/><br/><b>If I am directed to lose a check mark, can that make me lose a perk?</b><br/>No. You cannot go below the threshold of a perk, experience level, or prosperity level when losing check marks, experience, or prosperity, respectively. So if you have three check marks (enough to gain a perk), and then are directed to lose a check mark, nothing happens. You don't lose a perk, and you don't go into check mark debt.<br/><br/><b>If I unlock a character class through means other than retirement and it is already unlocked, do I still get the bonus of a random scenario and item design?</b><br/>Yes. No matter how a character class is unlocked, if you trigger the unlock and it is already unlocked, you gain the bonus of a random scenario and item design.<br/><br/><b>Do I keep my personal quest secret?</b><br/>There's not an official rule on this, so do whatever you want. I like to keep mine secret.<br/><br/><b>[R1 Errata] What's with this perk bonus for character lineages I've heard about?</b><br/>This is a rule that was missed in rev 1 of the rule book. Every time an individual player retires a character, that player gains one extra perk to apply to all future characters they create and that are assigned to the retired character's lineage. This effect is cumulative, so when a player retires their second character, their next character would gain two additional perks.<br/><br/><b>Which newly created characters do you consider part of a lineage if a player plays with multiple characters at the same time or alternates between characters?</b><br/>A lineage is a direct descendancy of retired and new characters as chosen by the player. If you created two characters and are playing them together in one session or alternating them between sessions, they each have their own lineage. When one retires, the next character you start can either be their own new lineage or part of the one that retires, your choice. If you want the perk, you'll want to make it part of the lineage of a retired character.<br/><br/><b>[R1 Errata] The second item in the Special Conditions for Opening Envelopes in the rule book talks about Drake's Request but that isn't referenced in the Scenario Book anywhere. Is this an error?.</b><br/>Yes. The second item should read "The Drake's Command" instead of "The Drake's Request." When you achieve this goal, you earn "The Drake Aided" global achievement. Also, it is optional to add the cards to the event decks and earn the achievement, but once it is done, it is permanent.<br/><br/><b>[Errata] When retiring, can players donate to the sanctuary and give the bless cards to their next character?</b><br/>No. The rulebook section "Donating to the Sanctuary" should say "character" instead of "player" <br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Enhancements</b></font><br/><br/><b>When calculating the total number of cards that can be enhanced against the current prosperity level, which cards do we count, the entire set of cards of the class, or just the cards selected by the character?</b><br/>You count every card in the ability deck of a class, which includes those selected by other characters and any higher level cards not yet selected by the character.<br/><br/><b>For the BLESS and STRENGTHEN enhancements, what abilities count as affecting allies or yourself?</b><br/>If an ability has a qualification below it (e.g. "Self" or "Affect all allies at X range" or simply "Range X"), and it is a beneficial ability, then you can enhance it with Bless/Strengthen (as long as it has a dot, of course). A "Move" ability does not count as affecting yourself.<br/><br/><b>When enhancing an ability that targets multiple enemies only when you use an elemental infusion, is it treated as a single target or multi-target ability when determining the cost?</b><br/>Single Target<br/><br/><b>Is an enhancement to an ability that summons several creatures treated as a single target or multi-target ability when determining the cost?</b><br/>Single Target<br/><br/><b>Is an enhancement to an ability that affects multiple allies treated as a single target or multi-target ability when determining the cost?</b><br/>Multi-Target<br/><br/><b>Does an enhancement's cost increase based on the number of enhancements already on the action to be enhanced or the entire card?</b><br/>It increases based on the number of existing enhancements on the specific action being re-enhanced.<br/><br/><br/><font color='#0033CC'><b>Scenario Effects</b></font><br/><br/><b>If I have the ignore scenario effects perk, can I ignore the effects of event cards?</b><br/>No. You can only ignore the specific effects outlined in scenarios as scenario effects.

The result affects each character separately if the word "each" is included (i.e. "Lose 10 gold each." means that a party of 4 would lose 40 gold total). The exception to this is if the result is gaining an item. In that case, only one character gets the item (decided among the players).<br/><br/>If a result contains "Start scenario with..." it affects all players, unless it says "One starts scenario with..." in which case it only affects one player.<br/><br/>There are a few cards with typos where the "collective" or "each" is not included (see below). As a rule of thumb, if something is missing, assume it says "each."<br/><b>TYPO - City Event 04 (R1):</b> "Lose 1 check." should read "Lose 1 check each."<br/><b>TYPO - City Event 06 (R1):</b> "Gain 5 experience." should read "Gain 5 experience each."<br/><b>TYPO - City Event 22 (R1):</b> "Gain 1 check." should read "Gain 1 check each."<br/><b>TYPO - City Event 46 (R1):</b> "Lose 5 gold." should read "Lose 5 gold each."<br/><br/><b>There is also a typo on road event 36</b>.

This means they do not trigger road or city events, unlock new scenarios, gain town prosperity or anything else that would impact the campaign world.

At this time, if any of the characters are still alive (possibly exhausted but not dead), then they would still survive.<br/><br/><b>Can you explain exactly how effects and abilities work with unconscious characters?</b><br/>If a character becomes exhausted from card loss, all of their cards are removed from the game, as per the normal exhaustion rules. These include all summons and active cards.<br/><br/>They don't get a turn per se but are treated as having one for the effects and expiration of conditions. The processing of that turn is nominally at initiative 99 and takes place after long rests.<br/><br/>The character may still be focused by enemies per the normal focus rules (including activation order tie breaker rules). They can still be affected/targeted by friendly and hostile abilities, including receiving new conditions. Some conditions won't be relevant, like bless or strengthen, but invisibility would be. They may be healed to keep them alive in case of future damage but remain unconscious for the remainder of the scenario even if healed. Conditions are removed per the normal rules (heal or end-of-turn expiration).<br/><br/><br/><b>Personal Quests</b><br/><br/><b>What scenarios are considered to be inside Gloomhaven?</b><br/>Any scenario marked on the zoomed-in inset in the top right of the map is considered to be in Gloomhaven (even 58 and 86).<br/><br/><b>Personal Quest 510</b><br/>[o]<b>What scenarios are considered to be crypts?</b><br/>Any scenario with "crypt" in the title. 4, 5, 6 and 19.<br/><br/><b>Since this is a special type of retirement, what can my character do after he completes the final quest scenario 54?</b><br/>Upon completion of Scenario 54, the Seeker of Xorn character does not have the opportunity to go back to town and sell items, nor perform enhancements, etc. Also, as stated in the scenario book, the character's retirement event card doesn't go into the deck.[/o]<br/><br/><b>Personal Quest 521</b><br/>[o]<b>What scenarios are considered to be inside the Dagger Forest?</b><br/>3, 28, 29, 38, 43, 44, 48, 55, 56, 59, 81, and 91.[/o]<br/><br/><b>Personal Quest 527</b><br/>[o]<b>Is this quest still used with the Permanent Death Variant?</b><br/>If playing with permanent death, you can either discard the quest and draw a new one or if you want to keep the quest, reduce the number of required exhaustions to 8.[/o]<br/><br/><b>Personal Quest 529</b><br/>[o]<b>What scenarios are considered to be inside the Lingering Swamp?</b><br/>19, 32, 45, 49, 61, 62, 68, and 79.[/o]<br/><br/><b>Personal Quest 531</b><br/>[o]<b>What scenarios are considered to be inside the Dagger Forest?</b><br/>3, 28, 29, 38, 43, 44, 48, 55, 56, 59, 81, and 91.<br/><br/><b>What scenarios are considered to be inside the Lingering Swamp?</b><br/>19, 32, 45, 49, 61, 62, 68, and 79.<br/><br/><b>What scenarios are considered to be inside the Watcher Mountains?</b><br/>9, 13, 63, 65, 73, 76, 80, 82, and 85.<br/><br/><b>What scenarios are considered to be inside the Copperneck Mountains?</b><br/>7, 14, 15, 16, 24, 25, 33, 34, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 54, 66, and 84.<br/><br/><b>What scenarios are considered to be inside the Misty Sea?</b><br/>17, 30, 37, 47, 64, 70, 74, and 93.[/o]<br/><br/><br/><b>Personal Quest 532</b><br/>[o]<b>Does the quest require two other characters to announce retirement or to actually retire?</b><br/>Two other characters have to actually retire in the presence of the character with the PQ - he has to be at Gloomhaven when they do.[/o]<br/><br/><b>If I have to kill a certain number of something, do I have to land the killing blow?</b><br/>Yes.

These coins are lost - the scout doesn't drop them again when it dies (just the normal one coin). The scout, however, cannot loot treasure tiles. Also keep in mind that this action does not influence how the scout moves.

The new ooze's <u>max</u> hit point value is still defined by its Stat card. Also, if the damage kills the ooze, then it doesn't summon at all. If there are no more oozes standees, the ooze will still perform the action, simply suffering damage.<br/><br/><b>Looting (Card 698):</b><br/>Just like a player "Loot 1" action, the ooze will pick up all coins on its hex or adjacent hexes.

Do I unlock those scenarios?<br/>No, scenario 14 does not unlock any new scenarios. There are many ways to arrive at scenario 14, and when you unlocked it, you also unlocked a scenario that couldn't be completed until you completed scenario 14 due to global achievement restrictions. The numbers at the end of scenario 14 are just reminders of where you should go next depending on what your goal was in the first place.<br/><br/><b>Scenario 19:</b><br/>The altar (b) can be affected by abilities that affect obstacles, though it is recommended that you not destroy it, since that would make the scenario unwinnable. The NPC treats the altar as a focus when determining movement.<br/><br/><b>Scenario 20 (R1):</b><br/>TYPO - "Boss Special 1" is not listed here. In addition to the abilities listed on the Stat card, it has the same summoning ability as "Boss Special 2" except Living Bones are summoned instead of Living Corpses.<br/><br/><b>Scenario 21:</b><br/>TYPO - Under "Special Rules" the position of the altar should be "f" not "a". Also, the labels for the demon spawns are off. The demons should be reordered to wind (a), night (b), earth (c), flame (d), sun (e), frost (f).<br/><br/>The altar acts like a normal obstacle with hit points (i.e. immune to all negative conditions), therefore the "and immunities" is superfluous and should not be there.<br/><br/><b>Scenario 25:</b><br/>Escaping - You complete the scenario when all characters either are standing on an exit hex or were exhausted while standing on an exit hex.<br/><br/><b>Scenario 27:</b><br/>Hail takes a turn during initiative 99 and will receive damage if wounded<br/><br/>Players can add their current money to the reward but they can't sell items in town because the reward happens immediately after the scenario ends, before players go back to town.<br/><br/>(R1) TYPO - If you already have a sticker in the space that "The Rift Closed" global achievement should be placed, do not cover it up.

For both of the boss's specials, consuming elements only affects the summoning. The other parts of the specials go off regardless.<br/><br/>Note that the Crystal of Zenith and Sphere of Midnight are not actual items and have no use outside this scenario. Use numbered tokens to keep track of who has them.
