			<subject>Official FAQ for Game (no rules questions please)</subject>
			<body>&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the official FAQ for all Gloomhaven related issues (the previous thread has been deprecated - this one replaces it). It covers all Revisions of the game. The Revision 2+ rule books are nearly identical. Many of the entries are already part of the R2+ rule books. However, since not everyone has the latest revision, those entries will remain in the FAQ. If an entry applies to a specific revision, it is noted as such (R1, R2+). Otherwise, the entry applies to all versions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the actual rules for the different revisions of the game are the same, and one of the purposes of this FAQ is to make sure their interpretations are in alignment. There were some minor changes to cards made for R2+ but these aren't rule changes, they are typo fixes or small balance changes (see this &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1761512/official-second-printing-change-log&quot;   &gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/b&gt; Please limit discussions in this thread to requests for clarifications, improvements and corrections to existing entries and to requests for new entries. If you have a question that you feel is not covered in this FAQ or in the rule book, please create another thread in the Rules forum, preferably with just one question (or related questions) per thread. If it turns out that it is not covered by the rules or the FAQ, go ahead and post a comment on this thread to request its inclusion. I'm subscribed to the entire forum so hopefully I will see it and do it myself but feel free to do so ahead of me (or if I miss it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FAQ is organized into sections to improve readability. Also, CTRL-F (or whatever Mac guys have) is your friend, use it. Entries covering monsters, locked classes, items and some scenarios are covered in spoilers sections. It is suggested that you read over those sections when you reach a point in the game where you encounter them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: I am not the designer of the game, that is of course Isaac. However, I am helping to update and manage the FAQ in my spare time because I enjoy stuff like that (yes, I’m aware I'm a freak ), I want to give back to the community of such a great game, and because Isaac is a hell of a lot more busy than me right now and the FAQ really needed an update. Also, I am the author of the &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/142767/rules-summary&quot;   &gt;Rules Summary&lt;/a&gt; document in the files section. It has received lots of good feedback and we have all endeavored to make it match the formal rules (including the FAQ). I mention it only in the interest of providing as much info here to make it as easy for everyone to play and have fun with the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;General Scenario Game Play&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abilities - Skipping, Order, Timing and Separate/Attached&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I choose to not perform specific parts of an action and what is considered a negative effect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may not skip the following abilities/effects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  * &lt;/pre&gt;Negative effects: Effects that when performed will (not may) reduce hit points, lose cards, or apply a negative condition to yourself or an ally .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  * &lt;/pre&gt;Stand alone infusions (i.e. not attached to a specific ability). Note that infusions gained from modifier cards are considered attached to the attack so they can be skipped. Also, for characters, at least one ability on the action must be performed in order to gain the standalone Infusion. This is not true for monsters, they cannot skip abilities and do perform their infusion even if they can't perform another ability during their action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  * &lt;/pre&gt;XP granting abilities, whether standalone or attached to another ability. If standalone, at least one ability on the action must be performed in order to gain the XP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  * &lt;/pre&gt;+/- X ability adjustments from modifier cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  * &lt;/pre&gt;Individual targets of an AoE attack - if you do the attack, all eligible targets in the area must be attacked. Note that Add Target and Target X are not AoE abilities and can be skipped. For Target X, you may attack less than X targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  * &lt;/pre&gt;Charges and their effects of a multi-use item or ability if the triggering conditions have been met&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may skip any other ability or effect, including some or all effects attached to an attack but you must chose to do so BEFORE drawing an attack modifier card. Some modifier cards have their own attack effects and you can choose to apply them after you draw if they qualify as optional effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I change the order of the abilities in an Action?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, any abilities that you choose not to skip must be performed in the order listed in the card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are separate attacks from an ability (like an AoE) resolved separately or simultaneously?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are resolved separately in any order the player wishes. Separate attack abilities in the same attack action are resolved in the sequence they are written. No attacks are resolved simultaneously. You resolve one attack, including any additional effects of the attack like push/pull or retaliation, then resolve the next attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When an ability says &quot;Do X to get Y&quot;, do I get Y, regardless of the results of X?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X and Y happen simultaneously so you always get Y. However, you may still not be able to benefit from Y if X causes you to be exhausted and Y is an effect contingent upon you doing something after your are exhausted (like resolving an attack or moving).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When an ability has a conditional bonus (like Move 4, Add +2 move if X is true) when is the condition evaluated?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The condition is evaluated before you perform the ability. So if during the move something negates X, you still get the +2 move bonus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When are abilities that say &quot;on your next attack action&quot; (and similar) actually triggered?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They trigger after declaring the target of the first attack but before drawing the modifier card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a card or item grants an extra action that happens at the end of the turn, when exactly does it occur with respect to other end-of-turn activities?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The extra action occurs before other end-of-turn activities. Think of it as a third action performed after your normal two actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If two effects are both supposed to happen at the beginning of a turn (such as a wound and a beginning of turn heal), which happens first?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I know if an ability/effect is attached to the prior ability or is a separate ability?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Abilities with large fonts are considered separate abilities&lt;br/&gt; - Due to card size constraints, sometimes a separate ability will have smaller font. However, these will have more spacing between them to denote they are separate abilities.&lt;br/&gt; - An ability/effect that references the preceding ability is attached to that ability and will typically be printed with small font.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below are examples of attached and separate abilities&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5243103"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/PSOXohkQbxfHNQebeJUQi-vOB0Y=/fit-in/200x150/pic5243103.jpg" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ability +X vs Ability X Cards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the difference between “Ability +X” vs “Ability X”?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Ability +X” makes an adjustment to an existing ability while “Ability X” grants the figure a new ability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Active Area, Card Recovery, Discarded Cards, Losing Cards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I play a card for its basic action, but the corresponding action on the card has the lose symbol, do I still lose the card?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;No, only if you perform that specific action text does the lose symbol take effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I recover cards during my second action, can I recover the card I just played with my first action?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Yes. As soon as a card is used, it is placed in the appropriate pile, so if your first card played is lost, you could recover it with your second card if it allows for such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the designation of cards in my active area? Are they considered in my hand or in their own class or what?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Cards in your active area MAY be moved to the discard or lost pile (depending on their symbol or the symbol of the action which placed them there) at any time and in order to meet game requirements, so you can think of them as already discarded or lost. When you recover discard cards (by resting, for example) or lost cards (through special actions), you have the choice of picking up corresponding cards in your active area OR leaving them in play. Discardable cards in the active area may be lost to negate damage (technically moving them to the discard pile first). Cards in the active area are not considered to be in your hand. When evaluating battle goals at the end of a scenario, the cards are considered discarded or lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a card has the lost symbol, do I have to perform all abilities on the card to lose it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;No, performing any ability on the card causes you to lose the card. However, you do not lose the card if you play it as a basic Attack2 / Move2. You must perform some ability of the action to actually lose the card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you lose cards to resolve damage prior to using defense abilities or items?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do persistent cards that trigger “at the end of your next X turns” also trigger at the end of the current turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When are abilities from Active Bonus cards granted?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active bonus abililties (like shield, retaliate, +X Attack, abilities from consumed charges on the card, etc.) are granted when the card is played and while the card is in the active area - and only if the requirements for the ability/effect are met. Other abilities listed on the card that aren't active bonus abilities are granted when the card is played. For example, Mindthief's Feedback Loop grants an Attack 1, Shield (if the Attack is made) and XP when played. However, only the shield can be triggered again (when an attack is made) while the card is in the active area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ability Card Reveal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If my leading card is revealed at the start of a round, when exactly is my second card revealed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are both revealed at the start of the round, just put your leading card on top. Once everyone has chosen their cards and revealed them, both of each player's cards are open information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantage/Disadvantage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I have advantage or disadvantage, how do I determine whether one attack modifier card is better or worse in the case of effects on the card beyond the typical +/- modifiers? How do I know when a comparison of the cards is mathematically ambiguous?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All effects listed on the card (negative conditions, elements, healing, etc.) have a positive but undefined value. Note that only the values and effects as listed on the cards and the attack's value (used for the 2x modifier) are considered when doing a comparison. This includes any listed bonuses on the cards that are in effect for the attack, such as from a performed elemental consumption. No other game effects or conditions should be considered (like poison, wound or item effects). Thus, these would be the rulings in the following cases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;/pre&gt;2x and Attack 2 vs +2: Ambiguous (2 x 2 = 2 + 2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;/pre&gt;2x and Attack 2 vs +1: 2x is better (2 x 2 &amp;gt; 2 + 1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;/pre&gt;2x and Attack 1 + 1 from consumption vs +1: 2x is better (2 x 2 &amp;gt; 2 + 1)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;/pre&gt;+1 vs +2: +2 is better&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;/pre&gt;+1 Stun vs +1: +1 Stun is better&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;/pre&gt;+0 Stun vs +2: Ambiguous&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;/pre&gt;+1 Stun vs +1 Fire: Ambiguous&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  &lt;/pre&gt;+0 Muddle vs +2 Stun: Ambiguous&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I an ally of myself?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do allied monsters count towards battle goals or personal goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do allied monsters drop loot?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ambiguous or Tied Situations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;In cases of ambiguity where players decide the outcome, how should the players decide? Should they do what is best for themselves or worst for themselves?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It is up to you. That is why you are deciding. It is assumed that you would decide whatever is best for you, but, again, it is up to you. Note that ambiguity with respect to attack modifier cards drawn for advantage/disadvantage are not decided by the players - the rule book states how to resolve that (use the first drawn card).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attack Modifier Cards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there any difference between an attack effect (elemental infusion, negative condition, etc.) caused by attack modifier, an item card, or one printed on the ability card itself?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, whether an attack effect is added by a modifier card, an item card or the ability card itself, it functions exactly the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it ever possible to do damage with an attack after the &quot;no damage&quot; attack modifier card or Curse card takes effect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. If this card is applied to your attack, you do no attack damage with the attack under any circumstances. Note that additional effects, including non-attack damage ones, still take place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What damaging effects are modified by attack modifier cards?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only attacks (specified by the &quot;Attack&quot; keyword) are modified by attack modifier cards. Traps, hazardous terrain, retaliate, wound, and any &quot;suffer X damage&quot; text do not cause attack modifier cards to be drawn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Battle Goals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does becoming exhausted from lack of cards affect my hit points in any way for the purposes of the &quot;Fast Healer&quot; and &quot;Masochist&quot; battle goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, you can still achieve those battle goals after being exhausted if your hit points were in the correct range when you were exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do allied monsters count towards battle goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario Setup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the exact order of my choices at the beginning of a scenario in terms of battle goals, ability cards, and equipped items?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first thing you should do when starting a scenario (after going through a Road Event when applicable), is look in the scenario book to get the map tiles set up, all the monsters you will be fighting prepared, and apply any scenario effects. Next, you should deal battle goals and choose one. After choosing your battle goals, then you can decided which items you would like to equip from the ones you own (adding in -1 cards to you attack modifier deck when applicable) and which ability cards you would like to start with from the pool of those you have available to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What exactly do you place on the map when you first setup a scenario?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When setting up, you place all the map tiles, all the doors, all corridor tiles, all the story point markers (1, 2, 3, etc.) and all objective tokens (a, b, c, etc.) and reveal the first room. When you reveal a room, you place everything in it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is open information and what is hidden information to the party when setting up the map for a scenario?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent and recommendation is that you try to only look at the contents of the first room (except for doors, story point markers and objective tokens). However, since all the contents of the map had to be fully displayed in the scenario book, it is technically open information. Obviously the scenario will be easier if you choose to examine all the contents before hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Components and Icons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;I know that if I run out of standees for a monster, no more are placed, but what if I run out of bases?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Try to find a suitable replacement. Standee bases shouldn't limit monster numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the red starburst symbol next to traps on the monster cards from the random dungeon deck?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symbol indicates the trap is a damage trap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if I run out of condition tokens?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Condition tokens are not meant to limit the total usage of the condition (unlike Curse and Bless). Use another token or make a note to keep track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;[R1 Errata] What's up with side B of map tiles L and D, they don't line up with the scenario book and the random dungeon deck?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Those are misprints. The &quot;b&quot; sides of the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;D&quot; tiles are misprinted and have their art rotated by 180 degrees in relation to their puzzle piece connections when compared to the images in the scenario book and random dungeon deck. When setting up these tiles, make sure their puzzle connection orientation is correct and don't use the art as a reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;There aren't enough scenario aid tokens to cover all the icons used in some scenarios, what's up with that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set of scenario aid tokens is not strictly meant to cover all the icons in every scenario. If necessary, use other markers as an alternative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;[R1 Errata] What do I use the Curse and Bless tokens for?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bless and Curse tokens were included in error and are not used&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;[R1 Errata] Where is the small envelop with a sun Icon shown in the picture of the rulebook?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It doesn't exist. It shouldn't be included in the picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;My damage counters, monster standees and sealed envelope count doesn't match the list in the rule-book. Am I missing items?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[R1 Errata] The component list in the front of the rule book should say there are 28 &quot;1&quot; damage counters, 240 monster standees and 3 sealed envelopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[R2+ Errata] The component list should say 236 monster standees. Note that 4 standees were removed from R1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you are missing items, you can get replacements here: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;http://www.cephalofair.com/contact&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;www.cephalofair.com/contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is the curse deck shared between players and monsters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[R1 Errata] No. The curse deck should be split into two equal decks of 10 cards each (Rev 2 has symbols on the cards denoting this).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One deck is exclusively for putting curse cards into the player's attack modifier decks, and the other is exclusively for putting curse cards into the monster's attack modifier deck. So no single attack modifier deck can ever have more than 10 curse cards in it. When a curse card is removed from a player’s attack modifier deck, it is returned to the player curse card deck, and a curse card removed from the monster attack modifier deck is returned to the monster curse card deck. If curses are distributed at the beginning of a scenario, distribute them as evenly as possible to all those affected, with players deciding cases of ambiguity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Damage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does overkill damage (damage past 0 HP) count for abilities that depend on the amount of damage &quot;inflicted&quot; or &quot;suffered&quot;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doors and Doorways&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are standing in a doorway between two rooms, are you considered within both rooms, within neither room, or you choose one? What if the doorway is between two tiles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You are in a doorway - you are in neither room nor tile. Note that if two tiles are connected by a corridor token, it is considered one large room but you are still in neither tile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster drops a coin on a doorway and then the door closes, what happens to the coin?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coin is removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if a monster is on a doorway and the door closes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster suffers trap damage and is then placed in the nearest unoccupied hex (players decide ties).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does each door token of a double door have to be opened one at a time?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exhaustion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Should curses and blesses be removed from a player's modifier deck immediately when becoming exhausted so that other players and monsters can use them?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As per the rules, they are not removed until the end of the scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initiative&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a character has initiative 99 and another is doing a long rest (which is treated as initiative 99), which one goes first in the round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character doing the long rest goes later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Item Use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What exactly is considered using an item for the purposes of battle goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any instance of you applying the effects of an item card to a situation is considered a use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When exactly can I use an item? Can I use it in the middle of a movement or other ability? Can I use items outside of my turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items are only used during your turn unless it is used as a reaction to an enemy  (as per its wording) or during a granted out-of-turn ability if the ability matches the item's restrictions. Note that wording like &quot;add +X to the entire attack action&quot; on an item expands the item's scope - it isn't a restriction that the item can only be used during full actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn you can use an item at any time, including but not limited to: during a movement, after consuming an element and gaining its effects during attack resolution, between attacks of multi-target/AoE attack action, or after you have taken all your actions - with the following restrictions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;Must meet all restrictions listed on the card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;If an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage or disadvantage), it has to be used before an attack modifier is drawn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;If an item grants an action, it cannot be used in the middle of another action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;An item cannot be used before/during &quot;start of turn&quot; effects nor after/during &quot;end of turn&quot; effects. Note that if an item (or other effect) grants an extra action &quot;at the end of your turn&quot;, that effectively extends the turn so items can be used during that extra action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there any limitation to the number of items I can use on my turn or even during the same ability?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When do equipped items become active?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Equipped items are active from the beginning of the scenario, such that if an item reacts to an enemy's actions, it does so immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is the use of an item card mandatory?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of items with charges is mandatory if it's conditions are met&lt;br/&gt;The use of items with passive effects is mandatory.&lt;br/&gt;All other uses of items are optional&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Item cards with circles to track multiple uses act exactly like persistent ability cards, in that if the situation applies, you must use the item in reaction and lose a charge. Additionally, it should be noted that if the card has a spent icon in the lower right corner, it is not technically spent until all charges have been lost, and so cannot be refreshed through resting or other abilities until all charges have been used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I use an item that says &quot;Heal X&quot; (R1)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an item says &quot;Heal X damage,&quot; it is functionally equivalent to a &quot;Heal X, Self&quot; action. It interacts with wound and poison like any other heal ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an item says it is used on the next &quot;source of damage&quot;, does that include when the damage is 0?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you have one item that prevents the use of another (like an item A that can only be used on a single target attack and another item B that adds a target to the attack), can you play both items by playing A first?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. You can play items in what ever order you chose as long as their conditions are met &lt;u&gt;at the time&lt;/u&gt; you play them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an item states its effect applies to a single attack and that attack is then turned into a multi-target attack, does the item's effect apply to the extra new attacks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a modifier card allows you to refresh an item, can you refresh an item that is used in the middle of the attack or must the item have been used before the attack began?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can refresh an item that was (or will be) used during the attack. Note that the rule that you can't use an item that affects an attack AFTER the modifier card is drawn still applies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kill Credit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an enemy dies from trap damage, who gets credit for the kill?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The credit goes to whomever causes the trap to be sprung, not whomever made it. If the enemy moves onto a trap on its own, no one would get the credit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an enemy dies from WOUND, who gets credit for the kill?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who gets credit for a mind controlled monster's kills?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No one&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who gets credit for a mind controlled ally's kills?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ally&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Line of Sight, Adjacency and Walls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What blocks Line of sight?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Walls and closed doors are the only things that block Line of Sight&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the line-of-sight rules?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Line-of-sight is necessary for all attacks (including every hex of an area attack) and all other abilities that specify a range (including looting, which technically has a range). Any non-attack ability that does not specify a range does not require line-of-sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are there any adjacency restrictions on what I can target with a melee area attack (area attack containing a grey hex)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only restriction is that you have to have line of sight on a figure to target it with an attack. Other than that, if the hex is in the configuration shown on the card, you can attack it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What exactly is considered a wall?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The edge of any map tile and the entire area of any partial hex along the edge are considered walls unless they are covered by a corridor tile. Doors are also considered walls when they are closed. Where the edge of a complete hex on a map tile comes up right to the edge of the tile, there is a dark border to remind you that a wall exists at that edge, though it does not technically begin (for cases of line-of-sight) until the edge. If two map tiles are set next to each other such that these dark edges line up (i.e. the border of the first and second room of the first scenario), the wall is considered to still be there as a one-dimensional line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an enemy is on the other side of this one-dimensional wall line from me, can I hit him with a melee attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not with a non-AoE melee attack. All range, even range 1 melee attacks, can't be counted through walls. In fact, for all intents and purposes (including looting), these two hexes are not adjacent and considered two hexes apart. Note that AoE Melee attacks use their diagram (not adjancency) to determine if a target is in range. The following image shows the range in green (range 3) between a source and a target. The blue line shows their LOS.&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4517063"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/tXH7kIOrWIV4cDwLxGqtNQJOCOo=/fit-in/200x150/pic4517063.jpg" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do the corners and edges of walls block LOS?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, if the sight line touches any corner or edge of a wall, or any corner or edge of a hex that is considered a wall, LOS is blocked.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does LOS work with destructible walls?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A destructible wall hex does not block LOS to itself. However, corners shared with other walls do block LOS to the wall hex. So a destructible wall cannot be targeted until at least one of its corners does not touch another wall and you have LOS to that corner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a figure is flying on top of something (like an obstacle), are they considered adjacent to it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obstacles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are obstacles with hit points considered enemies? Can they be poisoned, wounded, etc.?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obstacles with hit points are technically considered enemies for most ability purposes, but they are immune to all negative conditions, to force move abilities (like push/pull/teleport) and some special character specific abilities (see character specific FAQ entries)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Per the rules, obstacles cannot be placed if they block off an area of the map. How does this work with doors that may be opened in a future turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may not block off a closed door unless there is an open path to the other side of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about scenarios where parts of the map are blocked off from the start or become blocked off during play due to scenario instructions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treat each isolated section of the map separately for the purposes of this rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you allowed to create obstacles next to an area consisting only of obstacles (ex: several obstacles up against a wall)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, as long as you don't block off an open area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you destroy or move an obstacle inside a group of existing obstacles if it creates a blocked-off area?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I say X or Y at the beginning of the round when choosing my cards?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As long as you avoid specific numerical values and card titles, you can say whatever you want.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Puzzle Pieces&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are these puzzle piece references I keep seeing?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not sure, but I found a strange piece of a puzzle...&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4056375"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/oup5aVmvJZG8vifqh3-OdPE4ZC8=/fit-in/200x150/pic4056375.png" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;#GloomhavenNumberOneCelebrationMarch31&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Resting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When I do a long rest, when do the effects (healing, getting your discards back, refreshing spent items) take place?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effects from a long rest occur during your turn on initiative 99.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I have zero cards in my hand and two cards in my discard, can I still long rest even though I will become exhausted at the beginning of the next round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolutely. You can stick around for one more round as a meat shield. Also consider the following question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I long rest, do my summons still get a turn during the round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, they will act directly before your turn on initiative 99.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I long rest, do I still technically have a turn for the round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, on initiative 99, you perform the effects of the long rest, and it is considered a turn, so you can still use items or do other things you would normally be able to do on your turn (unless you are stunned, in which case you are only allowed to perform the effects of the long rest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you do a short rest in the last round of a scenario?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does a long rest cure WOUND and POISON? Does drinking a potion cure WOUND and POISON?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, these are both considered &quot;Heal&quot; effects and thus interact with WOUND and POISON like other &quot;Heal&quot; abilities. Note that the WOUND damage would happen before the effects of the long rest, so you would still take a damage before it was cured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I chose not to receive the heal or refresh items in a Long Rest?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. The only thing you have to do in a long rest is lose a card from the discard pile and put the rest back into your hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revealing Rooms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a character becomes exhausted, and then I open a door to a new room, does the room populate based on the non-exhausted player count, or the original player count?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player count that you started the scenario with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Round Tracker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the round tracker for? Do I need to complete all scenarios within 12 turns?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, the round tracker is only for specific scenarios. Unless the scenario has a specific reason for having you track rounds, don't worry about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario Completion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if we meet the scenario's goals but then the entire party gets exhausted during the round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You lose the scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a scenario is successfully completed, is there any penalty for being exhausted?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, you earn everything that you would have earned if you hadn't become exhausted: completed battle goals, tallied money and experience, bonus completion experience, any rewards in the scenario book granted for completing the scenario like bonus gold or experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I regain all my hit points once a scenario is finished?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do BLESS and CURSE cards stay in my deck once a scenario is over?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, Curse and Bless cards (including those purchased from the Sanctuary) and any -1 cards with a star in the corner should be removed from your deck at the end of a scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it possible to prematurely fail a scenario to avoid death or wasting time?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not technically, no, but if there are no monsters on the board and no more will be placed on the board without player action, then all players would be free to play out however many rounds it takes to exhaust themselves without danger. If all players agree, you can save yourself the time and call the scenario failed early.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If we fail a scenario, can we immediately retry it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, your party location is still considered to be at that scenario, so you can fully recover hit points, cards, etc. and immediately do the scenario again without doing a road event, or you can return to town or do another scenario, but that may necessitate a road event before starting a scenario depending on the linking rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I get the money and treasure tiles left on the ground when I finish a scenario?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, all loot left on the ground is lost once the scenario is over. You have to pick it up during the scenario. If you want the treasure tiles that you weren't able to pick up, you will have to play through the scenario again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I have to win a scenario to complete it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traps and Hazardous Terrain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I end my turn on a hex with hazardous terrain, do I take any additional damage?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, you only take damage when you enter the hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I or one of my allies spring a trap that I lay? Can monsters spring their own traps?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, traps have no memory once you place them. They become hazards for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I lay a trap on an open door, and then the door closes because of a scenario rule, what happens to the trap?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are abilities that force move an enemy one or more hexes (Push/Pull and abilities that say &quot;force move&quot;) affected by difficult terrain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if a figure loses flying on top of a trap, hazardous terrain or terrain with special effects?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The trap or effect is triggered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do traps placed my monsters scale with the scenario level?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Turn Scope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What exactly is the timing of a figure’s turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A figure’s turn starts when the previous figure ends their turn and ends when the next figure begins theirs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unoccupied vs. Empty Hex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you explain the difference between an unoccupied hex and an empty hex?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unoccupied hex has no figures (monsters, characters or character summons) present. An empty hex has no figures, tokens (money or otherwise), or overlay tiles present except corridors, open doors, pressure plates and scenario aid tokens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Player Abilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Action, Attack Action, Attack, Attack Ability, Attack Effects, Targeted&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What do those terms mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt; is the top half or bottom half of an ability card, or an item or persistent ability that specifically says it grants an &quot;action&quot;. An out-of-turn ability (like move or attack) granted by another figure's ability is not an action unless the granting ability says &quot;action&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An &lt;b&gt;attack action&lt;/b&gt; is an action in which an attack is performed. It constitutes any and all attacks made with that specific action. If none of the attack abilities of an action are performed, it is not an attack action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ability is considered an &lt;b&gt;attack ability&lt;/b&gt; if it has the word &quot;attack&quot; printed on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; is a single attack on a single target that flips over a single attack modifier card. If your attack action is, say, &quot;Attack 3,&quot; then there is only one attack in your attack action. If it is &quot;Attack 2, Target 3,&quot; then your attack action consists of three separate attacks. If the action contains separate &quot;attack&quot; lines, all are part of the attack action. If the attack is an AoE, all attacks performed as part of the AoE are part of the attack action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An &lt;b&gt;attack effect&lt;/b&gt; is an effect attached to the attack. It is applied either during damage resolution or after the attack (see list below). If it happens after the attack, it is applied even if the attack does no damage, including due to the NULL or Curse cards. You must choose whether you will do an effect to an attack before you draw a modifier card. Some modifier cards have their own attack effects and you can choose to apply them after you draw if they qualify as optional effects. Attack effects except Add Target are applied before retaliate (Add Target grants a brand new attack and one attack must be resolved completely before another is performed). Some attacks have Abilities (like Heal) that aren't attack effects but that are still attached to the attack. These abilities are applied after the attack is completely resolved (after retaliate).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack Effects:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;- +X (during damage resolution)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;- Pierce (during damage resolution)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;- Add Target (after the attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;- Push/Pull (after attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;- Conditions (after attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;- Infusions (after attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;- Conditional statements written in small font below the attack, like Cragheart's Heaving Swing (after attack)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ability is considered &lt;b&gt;targeted&lt;/b&gt; only if it says “Target” or “Attack”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an ability allows me to &quot;kill&quot; an enemy, is that considered an attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, unless the ability says &quot;attack,&quot; it is not an attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if I consume an element to turn an attack action into a kill action?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So long as you consume the element and trigger only the kill effect, the word &quot;instead&quot; negates the attack, and it is no longer an attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I kill an enemy with my attack damage, can I still apply the effects of the attack on that enemy (i.e., curse, push, etc.)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, added attack effects are always applied after the damage. If you kill an enemy with the damage, then it is no longer around to be pushed onto a trap or cursed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are abilities that target a single figure with an attack but damage additional figures via other non-attack effects (like suffer damage) still considered single target attacks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are multi-target attacks where there is only one current valid target or if there are current conditions that limit the attack to only one target considered single-target attacks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What exactly is considered a single-target Attack Action?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any action in which only a single target could be attacked. This excludes actions with multiple separate attack abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are the same differentiations used when mitigating &quot;damage from an attack&quot; versus a &quot;source of damage?&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, when something reduces damage from an attack (namely, Shield), it is specifically referring to a figure making an &quot;Attack&quot; and flipping over an attack modifier card. If you are reducing or negating a &quot;source of damage,&quot; that can be anything: attacks, traps, hazardous terrain, retaliate, wound, suffering damage from choosing a different card to lose when short resting, or any other &quot;suffer X damage&quot; text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When do the effects of deaths (like moving Dooms) occur: immediately after the figure dies or after the action completes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effects of death occur immediately after the figure dies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an Attack has an attached element consumption that grants an effect plus XP (ex: Consume Ice, Stun 1 XP) can you skip the effect and still get the XP? What if the monster dies as part of the Attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before you attempt the attack, you chose whether to do the consumption as part of the attack. If you do, you also chose if you want to include the effect as part of the consumption. If you decide to consume the element, you will gain the XP (it is mandatory), even if the monster dies or you decided not to include the Stun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you choose to discard a card during your turn without using it as an action (basic or otherwise), it is still considered an action?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Granting Abilities/Actions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is an ability that grants another figure an out-of-turn ability (like move or attack) considered an action for the recipient?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only if the ability says &quot;action&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can figures without attacks be granted Attacks from ability cards and if so, which attack deck do they use?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. They use the granting player's attack deck just for the duration of that attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can a character doing a long rest be granted an action - like from an ability or an item?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you use an ability that grants a figure an immediate attack if the figure has no current valid targets just to gain XP from the ability?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a summon has a &quot;-&quot; for its move or attack, can I grant it move or attack actions, respectively?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It depends. The &quot;-&quot; means that it has no base for that stat. So you can't grant an &quot;Attack +2&quot; action to a summon with a &quot;-&quot;, as that is a modifier to an undefined base, but you can grant it an &quot;Attack 2&quot; action, as that sets the base. The same applies to movement. Also note that summons (or monsters) with &quot;-&quot; movement can still be pushed and pulled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a summon/ally is granted an Attack X, which of it's base effects does it get to use? Does it keep its range?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack X replaces the figure's base ability so it is a melee attack unless a Range +X is specified or otherwise noted. Other effects from the Stat card (like poison, multiple targets, etc.) are retained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can a figure still perform actions prevented by disarm, immobilize and stun even if those actions are granted to the figure outside their turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Errata] No. The “on their turn” phrase listed in the condition section of the rule book should not be there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an ability optionally grants an ally an action/ability (&quot;may move&quot;, &quot;may heal&quot;, etc.), who chooses if the ally performs the ability/action if it is granted to an NPC or summons?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If granted to an NPC, the caster choses whether the NPC will do the ability. If granted to a summons, the owner of the summons choses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Area of Effect Attacks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I hit my allies with area attacks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, unless the action specifically states that you do. An area effect ability shows you the hexes that you can target with an attack, and you cannot target allies with attacks under any circumstances, so, in general, allies are safe from your abilities. Certain classes (the Cragheart, for example), however, have abilities that specifically state that allies in certain situations suffer damage or gain negative conditions, but these cases are clearly stated on the ability cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I target empty hexes with an area attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you are not technically &quot;targeting&quot; the empty hex, the hex of an area attack that is within the range specified by the attack can be empty so long as there are enemies in the attack area that are in your line-of-sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I target a wall hex with a ranged AoE attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, but the AoE pattern can overlap a wall hex as long as it isn't the initial target hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If my area of effect for an attack is chiral (not equal to its mirror image) can I use the mirror image of the area instead?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, in addition to applying any rotation to an area of effect, you can also use the mirror image of the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When is LOS evaluated for each attack in an AoE, all at once before the 1st attack or as each attack is performed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluate LOS for each attack when that specific attack is resolved&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you change the placement/rotation of the AoE pattern after resolving one of the attacks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. You must decide the AoE pattern placement and rotation before resolving the 1st attack&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are Melee AoE attacks that have hexes that aren't adjacent to the attacker still considered Range 1?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. So when using Add Target with a Melee AoE attack, the new target must be at range 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add Target&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If the attack has targeting or range restrictions, do they still apply to the new target?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. This includes &quot;exactly at range&quot; restrictions, restrictions that state an effect must exist on the target to be attacked or any other targeting qualifiers specified for the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does Add Target interact with area attacks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Add Target always adds a single extra target within the range of your attack to the attack, and this target cannot be an enemy already targeted by the attack (a single attack ability cannot target the same enemy multiple times). So if you got an Add Target effect on an area attack, you could pick one enemy within range but outside of the area (because all enemies in the area are already getting attacked) to get hit by the attack as well. All conditions and other effects of the attack (other than effects that would add additional attack targets) would apply to the added target, as well. Each instance of the Add Target effect adds an additional target to the attack using the above guidelines. Add Target DOES NOT add a hex to the area so effects that apply to the &quot;Area&quot; don't apply to the Add Target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that if an attack ability targets everything within a specified range, Add Target would do nothing since you are already targeting everything in that range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you perform an Add Target effect and not attack anything?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. If you chose to perform the Add Target, you have to attack something&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you gain Add Target for a single target attack that grants XP if the target meets a specific criteria (example: Scoundrel's Single Out), do you gain the XP for the new additional target if it meets the criteria?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Target X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the Target X ability, can you choose to attack less than X targets?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you perform a Target X ability and not attack anything?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. If you chose to perform the Target X ability, you have to attack something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does Target X interact with area attacks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is handled the same as Add Target, except the figure gains X-1 targets that all must be outside the AoE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conditions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a condition lasts until the end of my next turn, what exactly does &quot;next turn&quot; mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Next turn&quot; means your next full turn. So if you start a turn with the condition in effect, then at the end of that turn, it is removed. If a monster stuns you on its turn, then your next turn (whether that happens in the current round or the following round) you would be under the effect of stun, and then it would go away at the end of that turn. If you manage to get stunned on your own turn, you would immediately suffer the effects, then you would also suffer from the effects on your following turn in the following round before the effect wore off at the end of that turn. This also applies to conditions on monsters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I apply POISON with my attack, does it immediately give me +1 on the attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. All added effects of an attack are only applied after the amount of damage is resolved. The one exception to this is PIERCE, which is applied at the same time as the damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I have both the WOUND and POISON conditions and am healed, what happens?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both conditions are removed and no actual healing takes place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I voluntarily end positive conditions on myself like Strengthen and Invisible?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I get stunned before I have a chance to play my cards for the round, do I have to discard them, or can I take them back and do a long rest?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to discard them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can a figure still perform actions prevented by disarm, immobilize and stun even if those actions are granted to the figure outside their turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Errata] No. The “on their turn” phrase listed in the condition section of the rule book should not be there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does stun work with persistent effects and passive items?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stun does not affect them, they function normally. Passive Items are those whose effects trigger automatically when their requirements are met or whose effect take place immediately on scenario start (Iron Helmet, Hide Armor, Cloak of Pockets)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens when a figure becomes immune to a condition that it already has?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The condition is removed. Note this does not apply to Curse and Bless. Those immunities prevent the card from entering the modifier deck; they do not prevent existing curse/bless cards from being drawn and applying their effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if a figure is immobilized or stunned and they are pushed/ pulled?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The push/pull can be applied to an immobilized or stunned enemy - the enemy isn't using its limbs to move, it is being pushed/pulled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you clarify how gaining multiple conditions of the same type is handled?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As per the rule book, you can't have multiple conditions of the same type on a figure. When a figure gains an existing condition a second time, the new instance replaces the old instance, resetting the expiration turn. Note that curse and bless are not assigned to a figure, they are added to a modifier deck (which affects any figure that draws from it) and as per the rules, multiple curse/bless cards can be added to the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What specific abilities are prevented by invisibility?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only targeted abilities from enemies (those that say &quot;Target&quot; or &quot;Attack&quot;) are prevented by invisibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens when a figure without an attack deck (like some NPC's) gets hit with Curse or Bless?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nothing. Note that Summons do have an assigned attack deck (the summoning player's).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I consume an element in the strong column, does it go down to waning or all the way down to inert?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Whenever an element is consumed, it always moves down to inert, no matter where it started.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you explain the timing of elemental infusions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, the main take-away here is that any elements you create on your turn from any source (abilities or items) do not get moved to the strong column until the end of your turn. This means that you cannot create an element (that wasn't already present) and then consume it on the same turn because it won't be available to be consumed until the end of your turn. On the up side, this also means that if an element is already strong or waning at the start of your turn, you can create the element again with your first action, consume the existing element with your second action, and then the element will still go up to strong at the end of your turn even though you just used it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an element consumption is attached to an attack ability, when can I chose to consume the element?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before any attack of the ability, affecting all subsequent attacks of that ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an element consumption is attached to a move, when can I chose to consume the element?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The element can be consumed at any time during the movement - so before you start moving, after you move some spaces or after you move all spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When do you chose which actual element is infused for multi-color element abilities?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the end of the turn, when the element is actually infused.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I play a card just for the experience?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to perform at least one part of the action on the card to gain the experience. If it just says &quot;Attack,&quot; you have to attack an enemy to get the experience. If it has &quot;Attack&quot; and &quot;Move,&quot; however, you can just move and not attack and still get the experience. A larger experience symbol (as opposed to a small one) is not meant to be tied to any specific ability in the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I choose not to gain the experience from using an action?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, experience is not optional.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I am level 9, can I still earn experience?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can still track experience when you are level 9 as a metric for how well you are doing in the scenario, but experience no longer gives you any long-term benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a multi target attack has a Gain XP effect, do I get XP for each target?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only if the card specifically says so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a heal or other beneficial ability specifies a range, can I affect myself?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do the heal rolling modifier cards work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any time a &quot;Heal&quot; attack modifier card is resolved, the figure who flipped it heals the amount specified. This heal can remove wound and poison like any other heal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does a heal from a modifier card turn the action into a &quot;heal action&quot;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I draw two 'heal self' rolling modifiers in the same attack, is one heal performed or two?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Heals from rolling modifiers stack into a single Heal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if a figure is poisoned and a “Heal all” ability is used on it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heal ability is treated just like other heal abilities, so the poison is removed but no damage is healed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you use a heal ability on a figure that is already at full health?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Loot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I decide not to loot money or treasure tiles in my hex at the end of my turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End-of-turn looting is not optional. If there are money or treasure tiles in your hex at the end of your turn, you have to loot them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I perform a Loot even if there is no Loot in range?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are there restrictions on what I can loot with a Loot ability in regards to line-of-sight or obstacles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific mechanics are that you can loot all hexes within range X of you, where X refers to &quot;Loot X.&quot; This means that if you can target the hex with an attack in that range, you can loot the hex. This means loot is unaffected by monsters or obstacles, but is affected by line-of-sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an enemy or scenario effect forces me onto a hex with loot, can I automatically pick it up, like end-of-turn looting?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, end-of-turn looting happens only at the end of your turn. You cannot automatically pick up loot at any other time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I loot, say, an armor item from a treasure tile and I am already wearing armor, what happens?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can own any number of items (but only one copy of each). It is not limited only to what you can equip. So when you find armor in a chest and already have armor, you still get to keep the armor you got, you just won't be able to equip it until next scenario. Actually, since you can only equip items in between scenarios, even if you weren't wearing armor, you'd still have to wait to equip the armor you just got.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if I loot an item I already had a copy of?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this case, you would immediately gain the sell value of the item you looted, and place that copy of the item in the city's available supply of items if it was not already there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if I loot an item and there aren't any more copies available?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You would immediately gain the sell value of the item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which treasure tile rewards/penalties affect a single character and which affect all characters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All treasure results (with the following two exceptions) affect only the character that loots the treasure tile. The exceptions are the &quot;Random Side Scenario&quot; reward, which unlocks a new scenario for the entire campaign, and the &quot;Random Item Design&quot; or the &quot;Item Design&quot; reward, which places a set of items in the shop for anyone in the campaign to purchase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I loot a &quot;goal&quot; treasure tile in a scenario and then go back to do the scenario again, is the treasure tile still looted?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, unlike numbered treasure tiles, &quot;goal&quot; treasure tiles are reset at the end of every scenario and must be looted again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do allied monsters drop loot?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Move&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you perform a Move X ability but do 0 move?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some abilities state movement has to be done in a straight line. What does that mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It means a straight line of hexes starting with your current location, moving in one direction (no turning around and moving back).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How many movement points does it take for the last hex of a jump if it is on difficult terrain?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per the rules, the last hex is treated as normal movement, so it costs 2 movement points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Push/Pull&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I have to push or pull the full amount?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Like any added effect, you can choose not to apply it, but if you do, you have to use the full push or pull effect. The only time the full push or pull may not go into effect is if there are obstacles or figures in the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if there are multiple blocked and/or unblocked paths?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a figure is being pushed/pulled and there is an unblocked hex, it has to be used. If there are multiple unblocked hexes, the players decide. This is evaluated one hex at a time until the effect is fully resolved or there are no valid hexes for the figure to move into. This rule applies to pushes/pulls done by monsters as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can we push/pull enemies through other enemy figures?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, but they can't end the movement in the same hex unless entering the hex kills the enemy being pushed/pulled (from say, hazardous terrain).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can we push/pull flying enemies through obstacles and allies?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if there are multiple push/pull effects used in the same ability?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If multiple push or pull effects are applied with the same ability (due to attack modifier cards), you can choose to apply or not apply the push/pull from the attack modifier card (e.g. if your ability applied a &quot;push 1,&quot; and your attack modifier card applied a &quot;push 1,&quot; you could decide to push 1 or 2 since they are separate effects). Effects dependant on the push/pull (like Cragheart's Heaving Swing), apply to all pushes caused by the attack, including pushes/pulls from Attack Modifier cards or Items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does &quot;closer&quot; and &quot;further&quot; mean for push/pull?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are measured by proximity - count the number of hexes between the source and the target, except through walls.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I target allies with push/pull abilities?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, allies cannot be targeted at all, even if the ability isn't an Attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can flying monsters be pushed into traps?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They can be pushed into hexes with traps, but doing so will not trigger the traps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure Swap/Teleport&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are swap/teleport abilities vs monsters considered forced movement?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can teleport abilities be used while immobilized?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shield and Retaliate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When exactly does retaliate trigger?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retaliate triggers after all effects of an attack have been applied. If the retaliating figure dies from the attack, the retaliate does not trigger because the figure is removed from the board beforehand. If the retaliating figure is pushed out of the range of its retaliate, it also does not trigger. However, if it is pulled into retaliate range, it would trigger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is retaliation an attack, is it targeted? If I am invisible, can monsters still retaliate against me?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retaliation is not an attack nor is it targeted, so it is unaffected by invisibility. You can still be retaliated against while invisible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I take one point of damage from an attack and have multiple abilities (from ability cards or items) which give me Shield when taking damage from an attack, do I have to use all of them?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. You can choose which Shield bonus to apply in this case, and once the damage is reduced to zero, it is no longer a source of damage, so any other bonuses do not have to be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How long do Shield and Retaliate Last?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It depends on how you got the ability. Lemi esplain... no there is too mush. Lemi sum up:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;If they are on a card with charges, they activate only for the effect that triggers the use of the charge&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;If they are on a Round Bonus ability card, they are active for the remainder of the round or until you remove the card from the active area&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;If they are on a Persistent Bonus ability card, they are active until you remove the card from the active area&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;If they are from attack modifier cards or a regular ability card, they are active for the remainder of the round&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do summons perform end-of-turn looting?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, only characters perform end of turn looting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a summon has a &quot;-&quot; for its move or attack, can I grant it move or attack actions, respectively?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It depends. The &quot;-&quot; means that it has no base for that stat. So you can't grant an &quot;Attack +2&quot; action to a summon with a &quot;-&quot;, as that is a modifier to an undefined base, but you can grant it an &quot;Attack 2&quot; action, as that sets the base. The same applies to movement. Also note that summons (or monsters) with &quot;-&quot; movement can still be pushed and pulled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a summon/ally is granted an Attack X, which of it's base effects does it get to use? Does it keep its range?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack X replaces the figure's base ability so it is a melee attack unless a Range +X is specified or otherwise noted. Other effects from the Stat card (like poison, multiple targets, etc.) are retained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When summons attack obstacles, what initiative value do the obstacles have when resolving tie-breakers for monster focus?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obstacles have 99 initiative for resolving focus ties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can a summoner receive the effects from modifier cards (like item refreshes or heals) drawn by their summons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which attack modifier deck do player summons use?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The player's deck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster Turns&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Activation/Initiative&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a monster type activates, do they all go on the same turn, or does each individual monster have a separate turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each individual monster has a separate turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If two different monster types reveal the same initiative on different ability cards, which one goes first?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The players decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster is revealed at the end of a round from special scenario rules (not from opening a door), does it take its turn in the current round or the next round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do you determine initiative for a monster that is summoned by another monster if the summon doesn't have a drawn ability card?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Draw a monster ability card to determine initiative. Note that the monster will draw another ability card in the next round (when it would actually be able to take a turn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If there are revealed monsters of different types that share the same ability deck (ex: guards) and two monsters have the same standee number, in what order to they activate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players decide but they should be consistent from round to round. To make it easier, it may be best to activate the monsters one type at a time (using normal activation order rules). Alternately you can do all of the elites of the different types together, then the normals, deciding ties as needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Ability Cards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is considered an Action for a monster?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each separate Ability on a monster's ability card is considered a separate Action, even multiple abilities of the same type - like separate Attack abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster ability card doesn't specify an &quot;Attack&quot; or &quot;Move&quot; ability, do they still perform that ability?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. Monsters only do what is written on their card for that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster has bonuses like &quot;Shield&quot; or &quot;Retaliate&quot; on their ability card, is that active for the whole round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, bonuses only become active once the monster takes their turn based on the initiative on the ability card. It then lasts until the end of the round, where it will either get shuffled back into the deck or replaced with the next round's ability card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster has bonuses like &quot;Shield&quot; or &quot;Retaliate&quot; on their stat card card, are they always active?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, and they are unaffected by Stun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster is granted Retaliate by both an ability card and the Stat card, are they treated as separate effects or summed together and treated as a single effect (like for resolving &quot;on source of damage&quot; effects)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are summed and treated as a single effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster ability card lists a melee attack (like a melee AoE or “target adjacent enemies” effects without a &quot;range&quot; specified) but the monster stat card specifies a Range X, is the attack melee or ranged?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is melee, the monster ability card takes precedence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If all monsters of a type are destroyed and then new ones are revealed, do you shuffle the monster's ability cards?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. You only shuffle a monster's ability cards if the shuffle symbol is displayed or all cards have already been drawn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do you measure &quot;closest&quot; when resolving abilities like the Archer trap placement or summons that are placed &quot;closest to an enemy&quot;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closest is measured 1st requiring the fewest &lt;u&gt;normal&lt;/u&gt; movement points and then 2nd by proximity (but around walls)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a monster has a non-attack ability that doesn't define a specific target (like &quot;Muddle - Target one adjacent enemy&quot;), who does it target?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normal focusing rules are used to determine the target&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Attacks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you clarify how monsters do attacks against multiple targets?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Area of Effect, Add Target and Target X attacks are treated exactly like they are for players. Unless otherwise stated by a card, the multiple attacks cannot be done on the same enemy because they all come from the same ability. If a card says that multiple attacks are done on the same enemy (as an exception to the rule), the monster will attack its focus until it's dead/exhausted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a monster ability card has multiple attack abilities listed in different lines, they are considered &lt;u&gt;separate&lt;/u&gt; abilities and will therefore be used on the same target until its dead or exhausted, after which it will follow the focus rules to find its next target.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Errata] Note that the wording on Page 31 of the rule book regarding monster multiple attacks should read &quot;If the monster can target multiple figures with a single ability...&quot; instead of the &quot;If the monster has multiple attacks...&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;After a monster is done moving (or didn't have to move), in what order does the monster perform its attacks against multiple targets?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Bosses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are bosses elites?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, bosses are their own class of monster and are thus unaffected by abilities that target normal or elite monsters. Also note that named monsters specified in the scenario book are their own class of monster as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When do bosses do their special attacks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only when their ability card says so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Named&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a scenario defines all monsters of a type as &quot;named&quot;, are they still considered normal or elite?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No - they are now Named monsters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Conditions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you explain in more detail how monsters interact with invisible characters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invisibility works the same regardless of whether it is an invisible character or an invisible monster. Monsters can't focus on invisible characters, move through them (unless flying or jumping), or target them with any attacks or other targeted abilities (an ability like &quot;CURSE, target all enemies within range,&quot; for instance, wouldn't affect the invisible character even if he/she were in range). Monsters essentially treat invisible characters like obstacles, but may occasionally affect them with non-target effects (such as splash damage). Once again, however, an invisible character will never be focused on by a monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invisibility can create an edge-case where a monster is unable to find a focus, either because all of its enemies are invisible, or an invisible character is standing in a door or some other one-hex passageway to prevent a monster from finding any viable path to get within range of an enemy. Blocking a passageway like this doesn't always result in not finding focus. Flying or jumping enemies can ignore the obstacle (invisible character), and ranged enemies may still be able to shoot over it, depending on the value of their range and the positions of the other characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster is disarmed, will it move as if it has an attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, disarm negates all effects of having an attack. A monster will move as though it doesn't have an attack, which means it will just try to get as close as possible to its focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How are ability bonuses (shield and retaliate) affected by stunning a monster?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the bonuses are not simply given by the monster ability card. Monsters would have to perform a &quot;Shield 1&quot; action to gain the Shield 1, so these bonuses only activate if a monster is not stunned on its turn. However, abilities listed in the monster stat card are unaffected by stun as they are continuously available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if a non-stunned monster draws a card that gives it an on-death effect but then gets stunned before it dies?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The effect is applied, even if the monster is stunned at the time of their death.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a figure is immune to CURSE, what happens if it draws a CURSE card?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The card affects the figure normally (i.e. the figure does no damage). Note that it is only immune to the condition, which is the act of shuffling the CURSE card into the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster with a ranged attack is under disadvantage from being adjacent to its focus and is also under disadvantage for another reason (ex: muddle), will it still move to attempt to lose its adjacency disadvantage anyway?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. As per the rules, a monster will only move away from its target to lose disadvantage if moving actually does so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does curse from a monster ability card stack with curse as a trait from the monster stat card?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, 2 curse cards will be added to the target's modifier deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Doors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a door is closed due to specific scenario rules, what happens if revealed monsters are stuck in a room with no enemies to attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Closed doors behave like walls. The monsters are still revealed, so they would still play a card at the beginning of each round, but, until the door is opened, they wouldn't be able to find a focus, and so would not move or attack and just perform any other abilities on their card, as per the normal rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Elements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a monster's initiative comes up and the monsters consume or infuse an element as part of their ability card, do they each consume/infuse an element as they take their individual turns or do they consume/infuse the element as a group?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They consume/infuse the element as a group when the 1st monster takes their turn, with all the currently revealed monsters of that type gaining any benefit. However, if new monsters of that type are later revealed, they would need to consume the element again to gain the benefit (assuming it is available).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster's element consumption is attached to another ability (like Attack or Move) and can't perform that ability (ex: disarmed or immobilized), is the element consumed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. However, if the consumption allows the original ability to take place (like Consume for +1 Range which then puts the attack in range) it means that the monster CAN perform the ability and consumes the element to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Focus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;I'm just confused about focus. Can you explain it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finding a focus for a monster can be tricky in certain circumstances, but it follows some very basic rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First of all, is the monster performing an attack on the ability card it drew? If not, pretend as if it is performing a melee attack (i.e. it wants to be adjacent to an enemy).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, find path using the least movement points to get within range (and line-of-sight) to attack an enemy. Note that the monster focuses on a target but the movement path is towards a legal firing/attack position hex (unoccupied, in LOS and in range) - its destination hex. It doesn't matter if the monster can't get to its destination hex with the movement it has, as long as there is a path to eventually get to the hex it will still consider this path the optimal path. The enemy/enemies that are within range (and line-of-sight) at the end of this shortest path are considered the &quot;closest.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Side note on negative hexes (traps or hazardous terrain): negative hexes are considered obstacles when determining this path unless there is no path except through the negative hexes. The path can be ten steps long if the enemy avoids the negative hex and two steps long if it goes through the negative hex, it will still choose the ten-step path as long as it is available. Basically, monsters will move through as few negative hexes as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the case where the monster can use the same number of movement points to get within range (and line-of-sight) of multiple enemies (either because it starts its turn within range or multiple enemies or through some other situation), proximity (i.e. number of hexes they are away, not counting through walls) is then checked as a tie-breaker for &quot;closest.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Okay, now, if there is only one closest enemy within range at the end of that path, that is the monster's focus. If there are multiple closest enemies within range (and line-of-sight), the focus is the enemy among those tied who has the lower initiative/earliest activation for the round as determined at the beginning of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that there may be some cases where a monster can't find a focus at all. In order to obtain focus on an enemy, there must be an unblocked path (no walls, enemies, obstacles) to a hex that it can legally stand in where it could eventually move to and target the enemy. If an enemy can't find a focus, it doesn't move or attack on its turn but it can perform any other abilities written on its card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How exactly does a monster with Jump evaluate its focus/movement path?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster acts as if it has an infinite jump, just like it normally acts as if it has infinite movement. The monster treats anything that would normally block its movement (obstacles, traps, enemies) as an ally in terms of where it can move to (i.e. they can move through them, but not end their movement in the same hex). Then it follows all the normal movement rules (minimum movement required to get as close to the target hex as possible, thinking that it can move through anything).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster has jumping or flying for only one turn (say from an ability card), does it evaluate its focus path assuming it has jumping or flying for just its current turn or for the entire path?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster assumes it can jump or fly for the entire path (as if it was a permanent ability).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Mind Control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a monster is controlled by a character, is it considered an ally or an enemy of other monsters while it is being controlled?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is considered an enemy by other monsters for the duration of the mind control (typically either during the character's turn or during the mind controlled monster's turn, depending on the wording of the ability)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can enemies that do not have a base movement be granted movement abilities from other sources like mind control?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enemies without movement function like summons without movement. If they are granted a &quot;Move X&quot; ability, they can move, but if they are granted a &quot;Move +X&quot; ability, they can't.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a monster is forced to do an Attack X, which of its base effects does it get to use? Does it keep its range?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack X replaces the figure's base ability so it is a melee attack unless a Range +X is specified or otherwise noted. Other effects from the Stat card (like poison, multiple targets, etc.) are retained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you use an ability that allows a figure to perform an immediate attack if the figure has no current valid targets just to gain XP from the ability?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which attack modifier deck does a mind controlled monster use?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster's deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Movement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will a monster move away from its target if it is adjacent and is performing a ranged attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, monsters move a minimum amount to maximize their attack, so they will move away to lose disadvantage. If it can't lose disadvantage (i.e. is muddled or does not have enough movement points), it will not attempt to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will a monster move away from its target just to extend its distance (kite)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. It will only move away to maximize its current attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster can't get within range to attack with its movement, will it still move closer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, see the next question for how it will choose it's destination hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;After determining focus, how exactly does a monster chose its destination hex and how does it maximize its attack on its focus and any additional targets?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will determine its final destination hex (the hex where it can attack it's focus) by using the prioritization rules below &lt;u&gt;at the beginning of its turn&lt;/u&gt;. The evaluation is first done using the monster's current movement range. If the monster can't reach a hex from which to attack using the movement it has this turn, the rules are re-evaluated assuming infinite movement. Also, the monster uses its current attack when determining its attack/movement options, even if it may have a different (or no) attack when it eventually reaches its destination hex. If there are multiple hexes that meet the criteria, players decide ties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;1st - Attack its primary focus, losing/avoiding disadvantage if possible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;2nd - Attack as many extra targets as possible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;3rd - If there are still multiple attack locations with an equal number of different extra targets, use the focus rules (least amount of movement points*, then proximity, then initiative) from its starting position to determine which secondary target (in addition to the previous target(s)) should be included in the attack (repeating for a tertiary target, etc.) and select the attack location which includes these targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;4th - Lose disadvantage on the extra targets (all equal priority, players decide ties)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;5th - Use the least amount of movement points*&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Around walls, obstacles and hazards (if possible) using the normal, jumping and flying movement rules&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See this &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/234575/gloomhaven-rules-quiz&quot;   &gt;Geek List&lt;/a&gt; for various community created examples of monster movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;After selecting a destination hex, which path does a monster use to reach it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster will take the shortest path to reach the destination hex. If it can't reach the destination hex this turn, it will take the shortest path which brings it as close as possible to the destination hex. Note that if it can't get closer to the destination hex this turn, it will not move. &quot;Shortest&quot; and &quot;Close&quot; mean the fewest movement points around walls, obstacles and hazards (if possible) using the normal, jumping and flying movement rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does a monster do if it kills its target or the target becomes unreachable and it has additional attacks that may used against different targets (like from an &quot;Attack X, Attack X&quot; ability card)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the target &lt;u&gt;dies&lt;/u&gt; from the first attack, the monster will attack another target chosen via the focus prioritization rules. If the target is still alive but is now &lt;u&gt;unreachable&lt;/u&gt; (ex: was pushed out of range by the 1st attack), the monster will NOT chose another target. Note that if the ability states that the attacks are performed on the same target, it cannot chose another target even if the original target dies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if a ranged monster becomes disarmed while moving towards its target?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will continue moving along its original movement path towards its original destination hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if a player removes a summon from the board by moving the active card to the lost pile while a monster is moving towards that summon as its focus?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster would continue to move to its destination hex and if there was another viable target from that hex, it would attack it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Summons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do you distinguish between summoned enemies and other enemies (since summoned enemies don't drop money tokens)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can place extra scenario tokens (grey circles) on summoned enemies if you have difficulty keeping track.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do summons die after their summoner die?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summons of monsters stay alive, but summons of player characters will die when the player becomes exhausted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which attack modifier deck do summons of monsters use?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster's deck unless otherwise specified by the scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster - Traps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if a flying monster is over a stun trap and another monster attempts to move over that stun trap?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A figure cannot end their movement in the same hex as another figure so treat the flying monster as an obstacle when determining the non-flying monster’s movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Campaign&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Casual vs Campaign Mode&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How are sanctuary donations, road and city events handled when playing scenarios in casual mode?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sanctuary donations and city events can only be done if the last scenario played was in campaign mode. Road events can only be done if the next scenario is being played in campaign mode.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does playing a scenario in casual mode change the party's location?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. The party remains at their previous location - either at their last campaign mode scenario or Gloomhaven.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Character Unlocks, Leveling Up, Perks, Personal Quests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I level up, does my experience go back to zero?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How exactly does my &quot;pool&quot; of ability cards work? What can I add to it when I level up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your pool of ability cards is the set of cards you can choose to add to your hand when you start a scenario. The cards in your hand are the cards you actually play the scenario with and their number is limited based on the class you are playing. When you are starting out with a level 1 character, your pool consists of all level 1 cards, plus the three &quot;X&quot; cards in your deck as well. All other cards are unavailable to you. When you level up, you can take a single card of your new level or lower from the deck of unavailable cards and add it to your pool. In this manner, a level 9 character will add eight more cards to their pool over the course of leveling up from level 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a perk on a character sheet has multiple check boxes next to it, does that mean it requires that number of check marks to unlock it, or that I can acquire that perk for one check that number of times?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second case. If a perk has two check boxes, you can gain that perk twice for one perk allocation each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does the &quot;Ignore Negative Item Effects&quot; perk apply to any negative effects other than -1 Attack Modifier cards?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. That perk applies solely to -1 Attack Modifier cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I choose not to level up when I have the experience or not gain a perk when I have three check marks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. If you are in town and you have enough experience to level up, you are forced to do so, and must immediately gain all benefits from leveling up - this includes gaining a perk. [ERRATA] The rulebook should state &quot;MUST&quot; instead of &quot;CAN&quot; for the perk benefit. If you have three check marks, you must immediately gain a perk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I am directed to lose a check mark, can that make me lose a perk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. You cannot go below the threshold of a perk, experience level, or prosperity level when losing check marks, experience, or prosperity, respectively. So if you have three check marks (enough to gain a perk), and then are directed to lose a check mark, nothing happens. You don't lose a perk, and you don't go into check mark debt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I unlock a character class through means other than retirement and it is already unlocked, do I still get the bonus of a random scenario and item design?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. No matter how a character class is unlocked, if you trigger the unlock and it is already unlocked, you gain the bonus of a random scenario and item design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I keep my personal quest secret?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's not an official rule on this, so do whatever you want. I like to keep mine secret.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;[R1 Errata] What's with this perk bonus for character lineages I've heard about?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a rule that was missed in rev 1 of the rule book. Every time an individual player retires a character, that player gains one extra perk to apply to all future characters they create and that are assigned to the retired character's lineage. This effect is cumulative, so when a player retires their second character, their next character would gain two additional perks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which newly created characters do you consider part of a lineage if a player plays with multiple characters at the same time or alternates between characters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A lineage is a direct descendancy of retired and new characters as chosen by the player. If you created two characters and are playing them together in one session or alternating them between sessions, they each have their own lineage. When one retires, the next character you start can either be their own new lineage or part of the one that retires, your choice. If you want the perk, you'll want to make it part of the lineage of a retired character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;[R1 Errata] The second item in the Special Conditions for Opening Envelopes in the rule book talks about Drake's Request but that isn't referenced in the Scenario Book anywhere. Is this an error?.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. The second item should read &quot;The Drake's Command&quot; instead of &quot;The Drake's Request.&quot; When you achieve this goal, you earn &quot;The Drake Aided&quot; global achievement. Also, it is optional to add the cards to the event decks and earn the achievement, but once it is done, it is permanent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;[Errata] When retiring, can players donate to the sanctuary and give the bless cards to their next character?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. The rulebook section &quot;Donating to the Sanctuary&quot; should say &quot;character&quot; instead of &quot;player&quot; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enhancements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When calculating the total number of cards that can be enhanced against the current prosperity level, which cards do we count, the entire set of cards of the class, or just the cards selected by the character?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You count every card in the ability deck of a class, which includes those selected by other characters and any higher level cards not yet selected by the character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For the BLESS and STRENGTHEN enhancements, what abilities count as affecting allies or yourself?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an ability has a qualification below it (e.g. &quot;Self&quot; or &quot;Affect all allies at X range&quot; or simply &quot;Range X&quot;), and it is a beneficial ability, then you can enhance it with Bless/Strengthen (as long as it has a dot, of course). A &quot;Move&quot; ability does not count as affecting yourself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When enhancing an ability that targets multiple enemies only when you use an elemental infusion, is it treated as a single target or multi-target ability when determining the cost?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single Target&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is an enhancement to an ability that summons several creatures treated as a single target or multi-target ability when determining the cost?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Single Target&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is an enhancement to an ability that affects multiple allies treated as a single target or multi-target ability when determining the cost?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-Target&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does an enhancement's cost increase based on the number of enhancements already on the action to be enhanced or the entire card?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It increases based on the number of existing enhancements on the specific action being re-enhanced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario Effects&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I have the ignore scenario effects perk, can I ignore the effects of event cards?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. You can only ignore the specific effects outlined in scenarios as scenario effects. These will be listed in the special rules of a scenario and have the format of &quot;Do such and such as a scenario effect.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I have the ignore scenario effects perk, can I choose to still receive the scenario effects?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are all scenario effects listed in the scenario books affected by the ignore perk even if they may possibly be beneficial to a character?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are character summons affected by the ignore scenario effects perk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prosperity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do I track lost prosperity?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note it next to the prosperity track and then scratch out the note the next time you gain prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Road and City Events&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If characters drop in and out of a party, which ones are affected by the results of road and city events?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only the characters that are present when the event card is resolved are affected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I am forced to discard cards because of an event, when does that happen?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Even though events happen before setting up the scenario, you should wait until you've selected your hand of cards to decide which ones to discard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does it mean when a road event tells you to consume an item?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must equip the item into a slot, already consumed, but mechanics that allow you to refresh items can apply to the unavailable item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do I do a road event when traveling back to Gloomhaven from a scenario?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, you only do a road event when traveling to a scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which event rewards/penalties affect a single character and which affect all characters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a result starts with &quot;Gain,&quot; &quot;Lose,&quot; &quot;Discard,&quot; or &quot;Consume,&quot; the result is distributed among all characters however they choose if the word &quot;collective&quot; is included (i.e. &quot;Lose 10 collective gold.&quot; means that the party loses 10 gold total). The result affects each character separately if the word &quot;each&quot; is included (i.e. &quot;Lose 10 gold each.&quot; means that a party of 4 would lose 40 gold total). The exception to this is if the result is gaining an item. In that case, only one character gets the item (decided among the players).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a result contains &quot;Start scenario with...&quot; it affects all players, unless it says &quot;One starts scenario with...&quot; in which case it only affects one player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are a few cards with typos where the &quot;collective&quot; or &quot;each&quot; is not included (see below). As a rule of thumb, if something is missing, assume it says &quot;each.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;TYPO - City Event 04 (R1):&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Lose 1 check.&quot; should read &quot;Lose 1 check each.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;TYPO - City Event 06 (R1):&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Gain 5 experience.&quot; should read &quot;Gain 5 experience each.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;TYPO - City Event 22 (R1):&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Gain 1 check.&quot; should read &quot;Gain 1 check each.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;TYPO - City Event 46 (R1):&lt;/b&gt; &quot;Lose 5 gold.&quot; should read &quot;Lose 5 gold each.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is also a typo on road event 36&lt;/b&gt;. The symbols in outcome A should read as follows (the change is underlined in red):&lt;br/&gt;[o]<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3872486"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/8oBj-oJGCW5mKXGvJkEKAjXvAqg=/fit-in/200x150/pic3872486.png" border=0></a></div>]]>[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenarios&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If the party wants to go directly to a linked scenario but wants to swap out characters in between, does the party have to go back to Gloomhaven, thereby forcing them to take a road event before the linked scenario?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the character being swapped in has already been created, then you don't have to go back to Gloomhaven, but if you want to swap in a character that hasn't been created yet, you would have to return to Gloomhaven to create it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I play a random dungeon from the random dungeon deck, do they trigger road events and city events like normal scenarios?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. Random dungeons will not progress the campaign in any way. This means they do not trigger road or city events, unlock new scenarios, gain town prosperity or anything else that would impact the campaign world. They can, however, help with character progression, in the form of experience, gold, checks, and personal quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do bonuses/penalties from random scenario cards last one round or for the entire scenario?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They last the entire scenario unless otherwise indicated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a scenario's requirements have an achievement listed as &quot;INCOMPLETE,&quot; what does that mean?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It means that you can only play that scenario in campaign mode if you do not have the listed achievement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a scenario is actually in the town of Gloomhaven, would interacting with the town both before and after the scenario be considered separate visits (for the purposes of donating to the sanctuary and city events)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a scenario's goal is to kill all revealed monsters, do those include summons as well?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color='#0033CC'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Permanent Death Variant&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does failing a scenario interact with the permanent death variant?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the permanent death variant, whenever a scenario is failed through any condition, the scenario doesn't end until the end of the round in which it was failed. At this time, if any of the characters are still alive (possibly exhausted but not dead), then they would still survive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you explain exactly how effects and abilities work with unconscious characters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a character becomes exhausted from card loss, all of their cards are removed from the game, as per the normal exhaustion rules. These include all summons and active cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They don't get a turn per se but are treated as having one for the effects and expiration of conditions. The processing of that turn is nominally at initiative 99 and takes place after long rests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character may still be focused by enemies per the normal focus rules (including activation order tie breaker rules). They can still be affected/targeted by friendly and hostile abilities, including receiving new conditions. Some conditions won't be relevant, like bless or strengthen, but invisibility would be. They may be healed to keep them alive in case of future damage but remain unconscious for the remainder of the scenario even if healed. Conditions are removed per the normal rules (heal or end-of-turn expiration).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Quests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What scenarios are considered to be inside Gloomhaven?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any scenario marked on the zoomed-in inset in the top right of the map is considered to be in Gloomhaven (even 58 and 86).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Quest 510&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;What scenarios are considered to be crypts?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Any scenario with &quot;crypt&quot; in the title. 4, 5, 6 and 19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since this is a special type of retirement, what can my character do after he completes the final quest scenario 54?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon completion of Scenario 54, the Seeker of Xorn character does not have the opportunity to go back to town and sell items, nor perform enhancements, etc. Also, as stated in the scenario book, the character's retirement event card doesn't go into the deck.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Quest 521&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;What scenarios are considered to be inside the Dagger Forest?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3, 28, 29, 38, 43, 44, 48, 55, 56, 59, 81, and 91.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Quest 527&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Is this quest still used with the Permanent Death Variant?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If playing with permanent death, you can either discard the quest and draw a new one or if you want to keep the quest, reduce the number of required exhaustions to 8.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Quest 529&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;What scenarios are considered to be inside the Lingering Swamp?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19, 32, 45, 49, 61, 62, 68, and 79.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Quest 531&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;What scenarios are considered to be inside the Dagger Forest?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3, 28, 29, 38, 43, 44, 48, 55, 56, 59, 81, and 91.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What scenarios are considered to be inside the Lingering Swamp?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19, 32, 45, 49, 61, 62, 68, and 79.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What scenarios are considered to be inside the Watcher Mountains?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9, 13, 63, 65, 73, 76, 80, 82, and 85.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What scenarios are considered to be inside the Copperneck Mountains?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7, 14, 15, 16, 24, 25, 33, 34, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 54, 66, and 84.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What scenarios are considered to be inside the Misty Sea?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;17, 30, 37, 47, 64, 70, 74, and 93.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Personal Quest 532&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Does the quest require two other characters to announce retirement or to actually retire?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two other characters have to actually retire in the presence of the character with the PQ - he has to be at Gloomhaven when they do.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I have to kill a certain number of something, do I have to land the killing blow?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.

If you perform city activities after announcing retirement and non longer meet your retirement conditions due to those activities, you can no longer retire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Errata] Note that second sentence on page 48 of the rule book regarding Announcing Retirement should read &quot;The character may perform any other town activities before retiring, ...&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For quest cards 510, 513, 521, 526, and 529, I have to fulfill some condition and then unlock a scenario. Does the scenario unlock automatically once the condition is fulfilled or do I have to do something else to unlock it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario is unlocked when you fulfill the condition. You don't need to do anything else to unlock it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For quest cards 510, 521, 522, 526, 528, and 529, do these have to be different scenarios?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For quest card 514, can I experience this even if I am exhausted?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes. Note that your own exhaustion does not count, though.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For quest card 515 and 520, do I have to kill that many monsters total or that many of each monster listed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That many monsters total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For quest card 517, what counts as different monster types?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each monster stat card (the large square ones) depicts a different monster type. So, for instance, Inox Guards and Bandit Guards are two different monster types and each different boss is a different monster type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do random scenarios count for quest card 518?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For quest card 519, can I lose progress for this if I lose check marks through events? Do I gain progress if I gain check marks through events or bonuses other than battle goals?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, only battle goals count as progress towards this quest. It may be necessary to track this separately in the notes section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monsters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Living Bones&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Target one enemy with all attacks (Card 522):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally players or monsters with a &quot;Target X&quot; modifier to their attack must target different enemies with each of their multiple attacks. This card allows the monster to instead target the same enemy with each attack. Thus, a Living Bones with &quot;Target 2&quot; would perform two attacks, one right after the other, on its focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the target gets exhausted or killed by the 1st attack, the living bones will not attack a second target - the wording on the card specifically states that all attacks are performed on the same target.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vermling Scouts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Looting (Card 675):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like a player &quot;Loot 1&quot; action, the scout will pick up all coins on its hex or adjacent hexes. These coins are lost - the scout doesn't drop them again when it dies (just the normal one coin). The scout, however, cannot loot treasure tiles. Also keep in mind that this action does not influence how the scout moves. Since there is no attack written on the card, it focuses and moves as if it had a normal melee attack.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oozes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Stat Card Typo (R1)&lt;/b&gt; - Level 3 elite Oozes should have &quot;Shield 1,&quot; not &quot;Shield 2.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Summoning (Cards 696, 697):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note the damage happens before the summon, so new oozes come in at the new hit point value. The new ooze's &lt;u&gt;max&lt;/u&gt; hit point value is still defined by its Stat card. Also, if the damage kills the ooze, then it doesn't summon at all. If there are no more oozes standees, the ooze will still perform the action, simply suffering damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looting (Card 698):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just like a player &quot;Loot 1&quot; action, the ooze will pick up all coins on its hex or adjacent hexes. These coins are lost - the ooze doesn't drop them again when it dies (just the normal one coin). The ooze, however, cannot loot treasure tiles. Also keep in mind that this action does not influence how the ooze moves. Since there is no attack written on the card, it focuses and moves as if it had a normal melee attack.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spitting Drakes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Stat card Typo (R1)&lt;/b&gt; - A level 0 elite Spitting Drake should have 4 Attack, not 5.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lurker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Target one enemy with all attacks (Card 615):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normally players or monsters with a &quot;Target X&quot; modifier to their attack must target different enemies with each of their multiple attacks. This card allows the monster to instead target the same enemy with each attack. Thus, a Lurker with &quot;Target 2&quot; would perform two attacks, one right after the other, on its focus.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sun Demon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Consume Light: Target all allies within range (Card 652):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This should read &quot;Affect all allies within range instead&quot;.

The text under the &quot;1&quot; section should be read when the southern door is opened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPO (R1) - &quot;Boss Special 1&quot; is not listed here. It is exactly the same as &quot;Boss Special 2,&quot; except Living Bones are summoned instead of Living Corpses.&lt;br/&gt;Extra reward: Gain &quot;Item Design: Skullbane Axe (Item 113)&quot; when you complete this scenario as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 14:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the numbers at the end of the conclusion text referencing? Do I unlock those scenarios?&lt;br/&gt;No, scenario 14 does not unlock any new scenarios. There are many ways to arrive at scenario 14, and when you unlocked it, you also unlocked a scenario that couldn't be completed until you completed scenario 14 due to global achievement restrictions. The numbers at the end of scenario 14 are just reminders of where you should go next depending on what your goal was in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 19:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The altar (b) can be affected by abilities that affect obstacles, though it is recommended that you not destroy it, since that would make the scenario unwinnable. The NPC treats the altar as a focus when determining movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 20 (R1):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPO - &quot;Boss Special 1&quot; is not listed here. In addition to the abilities listed on the Stat card, it has the same summoning ability as &quot;Boss Special 2&quot; except Living Bones are summoned instead of Living Corpses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 21:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPO - Under &quot;Special Rules&quot; the position of the altar should be &quot;f&quot; not &quot;a&quot;. Also, the labels for the demon spawns are off. The demons should be reordered to wind (a), night (b), earth (c), flame (d), sun (e), frost (f).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The altar acts like a normal obstacle with hit points (i.e. immune to all negative conditions), therefore the &quot;and immunities&quot; is superfluous and should not be there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 25:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escaping - You complete the scenario when all characters either are standing on an exit hex or were exhausted while standing on an exit hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 27:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hail takes a turn during initiative 99 and will receive damage if wounded&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Players can add their current money to the reward but they can't sell items in town because the reward happens immediately after the scenario ends, before players go back to town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(R1) TYPO - If you already have a sticker in the space that &quot;The Rift Closed&quot; global achievement should be placed, do not cover it up. In this case, either don't place &quot;The Rift Closed&quot; sticker, or place it somewhere to the side of the map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 29:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The door with HP is treated as an obstacle with HPs with respect to being targetable - summons can focus on it, it is considered to have initiative 99, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 33:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The door with HP is treated as an obstacle with HPs with respect to being targetable - summons can focus on it, it is considered to have initiative 99, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escaping - You complete the scenario when all characters either are standing on an exit hex or were exhausted while standing on an exit hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 34:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(R1) Additional special rule - The boss is immune to any ability or effect that would affect its position on the map in any way (e.g. push, pull, forced movement, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(R1) This scenario should have an additional requirement: &quot;The Drake Aided (Global) INCOMPLETE.&quot; Additionally, completing this scenario should also trigger - &quot;Lost Party Achievement: The Drake's Command.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Zephyrs cannot be affected by any ability, and summons do not focus on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Errata] For boss special 2, the correct ability order is first summon, then move. The order in the scenario book is correct. The order on the stat card is incorrect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 35&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you destroy the wall obstacles?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 37:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escaping - You complete the scenario when all characters either are standing on an exit hex or were exhausted while standing on an exit hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 38:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Orchid stops moving if the shaman dies. Also, if the Orchid can't find a viable path to the shaman, it does not move. Note that per the scenario text, it can path/move through closed doors, opening them as it moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 42:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vocal cords are treated as obstacles with HPs with respect to being targetable - summons can focus on them, they are considered to have initiative 99, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(R1)Completing this scenario should award the global achievement:&lt;br/&gt;[o]&quot;The Voice Silenced.&quot;[/o]&lt;br/&gt;In addition, there should be an extra requirement for this scenario:&lt;br/&gt;[o]&quot;The Voice Freed&quot; INCOMPLETE.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 45:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The totems are considered obstacles so cannot be destroyed using abilities but may be affected by other non-damaging abilities (like the Cragheart’s obstacle manipulation abilities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 46:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Boss Special 2 - Stat Card Typo (R1): It says &quot;Summon P eggs.&quot; It should read &quot;Summon C eggs,&quot; as &quot;C&quot; is the abbreviation for number of characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Errata] The order of the Special 2 abilities should be Move, One Attack then Summon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 47 (R1):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional special rule - The boss is immune to any ability or effect that would affect its position on the map in any way (e.g. push, pull, forced movement, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 48:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After the boss's melee attack, it is affected by post attack effects (retaliate, on death, etc.) before he is removed from the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 49:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additional special rule - The Ancient Artillery is not affected by forced movement (pushed, pulled, switch positions, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the special rule damage to all characters is direct damage and is not considered an Attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 52 (R1):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Special rule - For this specific scenario, you can use the bottom action of any card to loot a treasure tile within range 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 54:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a player decides to start a new Cthulhu-Squid character directly after successfully completing scenario 54, this Cthulhu-Squid character receives the Staff of Xorn. Otherwise, the Staff of Xorn is added to the shop deck. The Seeker of Xorn character does not have the opportunity to go back to town and sell items, nor perform enhancements, etc. Also, as stated in the scenario book, the character's retirement event card doesn't go into the deck.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 58:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each bone pile is considered a separately performed heal ability, and they still heal the named monster even if it is stunned.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 60:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escaping - You complete the scenario when all characters either are standing on an exit hex or were exhausted while standing on an exit hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 69:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You don't have to end your movement on a hex adjacent to the well, you just have to enter a hex adjacent to the well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 70:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The living spirits are not affected by inta-kill abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 71:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Force movement - If the wind force moves a character to the right or left and there is an obstacle or wall in one of the possible hexes, the player may chose to either be blocked (not move) or move to the open hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Escaping - You complete the scenario when all characters either are standing on an exit hex or were exhausted while standing on an exit hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 72 (R1):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPO - Use map tile L1b instead of L2b.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 75:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The setup calls for 5 stump overlays but there are only 4 in the game. Use another overlay as an alternative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 77:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters that have the ability to create obstacles cannot block all pressure plates simultaneously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 78:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The victims are considered figures allied to no-one and therefore restrict movement to monsters and characters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 79:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bosses two abilities can affect invisible characters. They also require LOS. The boss’s mind control can only be used on characters that have not yet acted in the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 81:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPO (R1) - In the special rules of section 1, &quot;the Betrayer&quot; should instead be &quot;the Colorless.&quot; For both of the boss's specials, consuming elements only affects the summoning. The other parts of the specials go off regardless.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that the Crystal of Zenith and Sphere of Midnight are not actual items and have no use outside this scenario. Use numbered tokens to keep track of who has them. At the end of the scenario, win or lose, these two &quot;goal&quot; treasures are reset so that these two items can be looted again, just like any other &quot;goal&quot; treasures in the game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 82:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What happens if the player with the items is exhausted without reaching the exit? If the scenario is failed, do we still get to keep the items we looted?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the player holding the items is exhausted, the scenario is failed. If the scenario is failed, the items are returned to the treasure tile and you can loot it again on your next attempt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 83:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After reading section 2, the 1st set of special rules terminate and are replaced with the 2nd set of special rules. The altar has no HP and cannot be destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 84 (R1):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The crystal is not considered an enemy and is not targeted by character summons&lt;br/&gt;TYPO - The author's name is David Isakov, not David Jansen. Sorry David!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 85:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario book says to spawn 8 sun demons when playing 4 players but there are only 6 standees, what gives?&lt;br/&gt;This is an error in the book. For 4 players, don't place the night demon and sun demons in the final room that are only placed as normal enemies for 4 players (i.e. they're colored black for 2 and 3 players and white for 4 players)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scenario 93:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire row of staring hexes are Water hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solo Scenarios:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can buy items before doing a solo scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brute Solo Scenario:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERRATA - The PDF version of the Solo Scenarios book has a special rule that states that the monsters should be setup at 1 level less than normal. This is incorrect. The printed version of the book is correct (it does not have this special rule).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sun Class Solo Scenario:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPO - The special rules for (1) should read “Two normal Inox Guards.” They spawn in both locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Random Scenario Cards:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPO - Cards 542, 546, 549 - Art should be rotated 180 degrees.&lt;br/&gt;TYPO - Card 535 - Icons and overlay tiles should be mirrored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Characters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3872497"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/square/img/fgOBtkrnzqzlb54QPLeVNLQr4eo=/75x75/pic3872497.jpg" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 1 and X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Trample (Card 001):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the bottom action, the attacks are resolved after the movement is completely finished (so no enemy retaliations that are out of range of the ending hex). They are considered melee attacks, but you do not have to be adjacent to the targets at the end of the movement. However, you must have LOS to a target from your ending hex in order to attack it. Also, you cannot attack the same target multiple times.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Provoking Roar (Card 004):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom ability - If the Brute is invisible, a monster cannot target the Brute and will attack the original target instead[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3872506"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/square/img/5YrvgCs8n6ggGY8RemLH6V2WO8Q=/75x75/pic3872506.jpg" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 1 and X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Harmless Contraption (Card 031):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This summon has no attack action or a base attack value. It cannot be commanded to attack with an &quot;Attack +X&quot; action, but it can be commanded to attack with an &quot;Attack X&quot; action (e.g. the Mindthief's &quot;Possession&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flamethrower (Card 032):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bottom effect applies to allies only while they are adjacent to you (like an aura), not allies adjacent to you at the time this action was performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reinvigorating Elixir (Card 037):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bottom ability can be used on allies who are long resting for the round. In such case, when their long rest occurs at the end of the round, they do not recover any discards (because they have none), and thus do not have to lose any cards. They simply perform the other parts of the long rest, healing two hit points and refreshing their spent items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enhancement Field (Card 040):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bottom effect applies to allies only while they are adjacent to you (like an aura), not allies adjacent to you at the time this action was performed.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 8&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Harsh Stimulants (Card 058):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first part of the bottom effect applies to allies who are currently adjacent to you, not allies that were adjacent to you at the time the action was performed. The bottom effect, however, applies when you perform the action, since it is not an active bonus.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Chimeric Formula (Card 060):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So this is probably the most ridiculous action in the game. You're level 9, so have a little fun. The bottom action allows for any class to get the card of any another class in their hand to use as they would their own cards. For instance, the Brute could gain one of the Mindthief's augments. The sky's the limit, except that lost cards that cannot be recovered still cannot be recovered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, for the top action, it is the ally that loses the cards.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3872507"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/square/img/ZLA8TBweQ9ztTbtW6dsuEYqhEpo=/75x75/pic3872507.jpg" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 1 and X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Impaling Eruption (Card 062):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with any ranged ability, you can trace the path to your target however you would like.

Any added effects from the monster's stat card are also applied to the attack, and the monster uses the monster attack modifier deck. This is not a targeted ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feedback Loop (Card 149):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Shield effect can stack for each separate attack you make. Place a character token on this card for each attack, and each token adds &quot;Shield 1.&quot; These tokens are removed from the card at the end of the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Mind's Weakness (Card 151) (R1):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TYPO - The top ability should read &quot;On your melee attacks:&quot; just like all the other augment cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perverse Edge (Card 154):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the top action, the bonus does not count negative conditions applied by the attack, since negative conditions are applied after damage is dealt. The bonus only counts negative conditions that were on the target before the attack. It also does not count curse, as that effect is not target specific.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Hostile Takeover (Card 160):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bottom action has no effect on enemies who have already acted in the round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Errata] The top action for the French version of the card should NOT say that you control the action.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Pilfer (Card 163):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You cannot loot enemies if you can't loot at least one token on the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cranium Overload (Card 164):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You do not gain experience for the initial enemy killed with the top action.

When these cards are discarded, or the scenario ends, return them to the Sawbones' supply.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Prep for Surgery (Card 445):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unless the range is otherwise stated, all moves and attacks can become heals with a range of 1 (affect yourself or an adjacent ally).[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3872555"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/square/img/n-7BxQLdz1OQj0dSGRI9mfVpW08=/75x75/pic3872555.jpg" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 1 and X&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Raw Enhancement  (Card 476):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When exactly do you consume the element for upgrading the movement?&lt;br/&gt;The element can be consumed at any time during the movement - so before you start moving, after you move some spaces or after you move all spaces.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Chain Lightning (Card 463):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If an Add Target effect is applied to the card, it adds a single attack vs. a different target using the main ability values (which can be boosted if light is consumed).[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Simulacrum (Card 469):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Errata] The bottom of the card should read &quot;attack abilities&quot; instead of &quot;attack actions&quot;. Only attack abilities can be performed from the summon's position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the summon on the bottom, for any attack ability, you can choose to originate it on your hex, or the summon's hex, but not both. So something like &quot;target all enemies within range 4&quot; would target either all enemies within range 4 of you, or all enemies within range 4 of your summon. Keep in mind that you are still the source of the attack, so you would only suffer disadvantage on a ranged attack, or suffer the effects of a non-ranged retaliate, if the attacked enemy was adjacent to you. Also note this summon has no attack action or a base attack value. It cannot be commanded to attack with an &quot;Attack +X&quot; action, but it can be commanded to attack with an &quot;Attack X&quot; action (e.g. the Mindthief's &quot;Possession&quot;).[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 9&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Ethereal Manifestation (Card 474):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bottom is the only action in the game that does not have a base ability. Consuming elements gives you different abilities you can perform in whatever order you want. For instance, you could consume fire, wind, and ice to move 3 hexes, loot 1, and then perform the attack 3, range 3.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3872595"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/square/img/pwIsgSGWObZPESCRtz6y9b1UnYk=/75x75/pic3872595.jpg" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;General&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]You can put the extra card in your active area to keep track of the bear's attack and move values if you want (consider it a lost card that cannot be recovered), but it should be pretty easy to remember after a game or two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Command&lt;/b&gt; actions allow only the bear to perform the abilities on them - not the Beast Tyrant or any other summon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that unless a card specifically says it only affects summoned allies you own, it can affect any summoned ally, including those of other players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you voluntarily remove the bear from the board?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. However, it is still considered a summoned figure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can the bear open doors with a Command action?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How does the bear running out of hit points interact with the permanent death variant?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like any other summon, the bear will always be available to summon again in the next scenario. Permanent death would only apply if the Beast Tyrant himself ran out of hit points.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Maul (Card 484):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shield for the bottom ability is NOT an aura.

It has no move action or base move value. It cannot be commanded to attack or move with an &quot;Attack +X&quot; or &quot;Move +X&quot; action, but it can be commanded to attack with an &quot;Attack X&quot; action (e.g. the Mindthief's &quot;Possession&quot;) or to move with a &quot;Move X&quot; action. It can also be pushed or pulled as normal.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 7&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Storm Sigil (Card 500):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This summon has no move action or base move value.

			<body>Great work!&lt;br/&gt;The &quot;Level 1&quot; section for cards could be changed to &quot;Level 1 and X&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;How are sanctuary donations and city events handled when playing scenarios in casual mode?&quot; should also cover Road Events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: Regarding &quot;(R2) The component list should say 236 monster standees. Note that 4 standees were removed from R1.&quot;: You should mention that there are four blank standees in R2.</body>

May I suggest that we keep this FAQ seperate from all discussions?&lt;br/&gt;Let's just collect official rulings in this thread and discuss the topics in the rule forum...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm cool with discussions about entry clarifications, corrections and requests for additions. I just don't want to have general rules questions in the thread to avoid the 100 page plus situation with the old FAQ.</body>

			<body>So, there's a few things I'd like to address:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;An attack is a single attack on a single target that flips over a single attack modifier card. If your attack action is, say, &quot;Attack 3,&quot; then there is only one attack in your attack action. If it is &quot;Attack 2, Target 3,&quot; then your attack action consists of three separate attacks. &lt;u&gt;If the action contains separate &quot;attack&quot; lines, all are part of the attack action.&lt;/u&gt; If the attack is an AoE, all attacks performed as part of the AoE are part of the attack action.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is the underlined implying that an action such as &quot;Attack 2, Move 2, Attack 2&quot; could be turned into &quot;Attack 3, Move 2, Attack 3&quot; via a Minor Power Potion? For reference, Minor Power Potion reads: &quot;During your attack, add +1 Attack to your entire Attack action&quot;. If so, I strongly feel as though this might be incorrect??? Please verify; I may have to start questioning my whole existence, haha...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which treasure tile rewards/penalties affect a single character and which affect all characters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All treasure results (with the following two exceptions) affect only the character that loots the treasure tile. The exceptionsare the &quot;Random Side Scenario&quot; reward, which unlocks a new scenario for the entire campaign, and &lt;u&gt;the &quot;Random Item Design&quot; reward&lt;/u&gt;, which places a set of items in the shop for anyone in the campaign to purchase.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do believe that anything simply referred to as a &quot;design&quot; is added to the shop, not just the random items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster type consumes an element due to its ability card, does only the first monster who acts gain the effect or all the monsters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When monsters consume an element, all monsters of that type gain the benefit when they activate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the wording, it might be helpful(?) to add a note here that if more of the same monster type are revealed later in the round, they do not gain the benefit from the earlier consumed element, as there is no longer an element for them to consume.</body>

			<body>&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;An attack effect is the effect that occurs after the attack. It occurs even if the attack does no damage, including due to the NULL or Curse cards. You must chose whether you will do an effect attached to an attack before you draw a modifier card.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is it ever possible to do damage with an attack after the &quot;no damage&quot; attack modifier card or Curse card takes effect?&lt;br/&gt;No. If this card is applied to your attack, you do no direct damage with the attack under any circumstances.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've been looking around trying to resolve these two rules - regarding secondary effects that do damage - and haven't been satisfied with anything I've found.  For instance, if I use the cragheart's card that does:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack: 3&lt;br/&gt;Range: 3&lt;br/&gt;Each ally and enemy adjacent to the target takes 1 damage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And I draw my NULL or a CURSE from my modifier deck, does the secondary effect still happen?  Does &quot;direct damage&quot; only refer to damage from an attack action?  And therefore any damage that results from secondary effects will always happen, regardless of if I draw a NULL or CURSE?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The phrase &quot;direct damage&quot; in the FAQ is undefined in the rules and therefore ambiguous.</body>

We'll reword the FAQ to make this more clear.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe that your character still has the option to push for example towards an obstacle even if there is a valid place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>Here's a fun one.  If I loot a chest for its contents, then go back to that scenario either because I failed it or am doing it in casual mode, will the chest still be there and just be empty, but still &quot;lootable&quot;? Or just not be spawned at all?  I ask based on the battle goal that it would count towards.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I assume it's simply not spawned but wanted to check. </body>

			<body>Not necessarily a FAQ question, but also not necessarily worth its own thread...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm wondering which punchboard Living Bones #4 comes from. I think it was Punchboard 7. I see that it's either 7 or 8, and I'm assuming they were numbered 1-5 on 7 and 6-10 on 8 but don't want to make an assumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to anyone who can confirm!</body>

			<body>Wait, hold on. I read the &quot;can't target same enemy&quot; line as saying that you can't use abilities that have additional targets on the same target. But if a card simply has two lines that both say Attack, then that should be fair game to target the same enemy. Am I wrong? Would &quot;-Attack 2  -Move 2  -Attack 2&quot; not be able to target the same enemy with both attacks? I'm gonna need some receipts for this.</body>

			<body>Yes, this wording in the OP is unfortunate. Issac has stated several times that the R1 rule set is as viable as the R2 rule set. R2 is no errata to R1, it's just a slightly different variant. Owners of R1 should not feel obliged to change any rules. Therefore it makes sense to keep older FAQs exclusive to R1 in this thread.</body>

			<body>Except that there are MANY other minor changes (amount of experience on &quot;charge cards,&quot; minor movement length changes, etc., And to make all the cards the same there would be a long line of things to &quot;fix&quot; in first edition.</body>

I noticed in the official (but now locked) change log thread that this PG should have its threshold reduced from 15 to 12. However, my Rev2 version of the card still shows a threshold of 15.

			<body>Page 22 of the rulebook  &lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;ADD TARGET – If a figure triggers this effect with an attack action, the figure may add an&lt;br/&gt;additional target within range to their attack. All added effects and conditions of the attack action&lt;br/&gt;are applied to the target, as well, except for effects that would result in additional targets outside&lt;br/&gt;of the original added target (e.g., area attacks).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this case, &quot;added targets&quot; is separate from additional ATTACK lines, which is what the rule you are quoting references. In cases of added targets, normal added target rules apply. The same way you can't target the same enemy three times with the Spellweaver's Flame Orbs, etc.</body>

			<body>I did too, at first... but it kind of makes sense that &quot;Attack, Move, Attack&quot; is intended to hit two enemies, rather than &quot;Hit 1, if it's not dead: don't move, attack again&quot;  But &quot;Attack Attack Attack&quot; seems to suggest attacking three times whatever is in reach (even if it's the same thing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Official clarification would be great.</body>

			<body>Alex, I've got 2 things:&lt;br/&gt;1) Persistence of attack-triggered shields (ex: hide armor, chainmail) -- these read almost identically to the Mindthief's Augments, yet Isaac has clarified that these are intended to only apply for the current attack.  Could you please add this to the FAQ?  (Something along the lines of: &quot;Shield abilities triggered by attack damage only last until the end of that attack.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had to search for quite some time to actually find a ruling on this (meanwhile, we played a scenario assuming persistence until end of round because of the similarity):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25092393#25092393&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25092393#25092393&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Can we please get this FAQ pinned instead of the original FAQ?  Having to click through the deprecated one seems inefficient.</body>

			<body>If an ability states it &quot;deals&quot; damage to an enemy, does the enemy suffer the damage (and you ignore the attack rules such as drawing attack modifier cards) or do you perform an attack? In other words, does the keyword &quot;deal&quot; imply the same rules as &quot;suffer&quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDIT: It's about this action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]Once during each of your Move actions, you may suffer 1 damage to deal 3 damage to one poisoned enemy.

Could you please add this to the FAQ?  (Something along the lines of: &quot;Shield abilities triggered by attack damage only last until the end of that attack.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had to search for quite some time to actually find a ruling on this (meanwhile, we played a scenario assuming persistence until end of round because of the similarity):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25092393#25092393&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25092393#25092393&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hmm, I don't think I can do it with a generalized entry, since it seems to be item specific so I'll make entries for those specific items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone know of any others besides hide armor and chainmail where the wording needs expansion?&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>I feel the FAQ and players would benefit greatly if an ERRATA section was added. A section detailing rulings or corrections that have been made that differ from what's written in the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, there's a clear errata made to the rules mixed in with the answer to this question in the FAQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can a figure still perform actions prevented by immobilize and stun even if those actions are granted to the figure outside their turn?&lt;br/&gt;No. [BGCOLOR=#FFFF00]The “on their turn” phrase listed in the condition section of the rule book should not be there.[/BGCOLOR]</body>

			<body>There needs to be a section in the FAQ on starting and stopping of conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is what I found in the FAQ so far&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a monster has bonuses like &quot;Shield&quot; or &quot;Retaliate&quot; on their ability card, is that active for the whole round?&lt;br/&gt;No, bonuses only become active once the monster takes their turn based on the initiative on the ability card. It then lasts until the end of the round, where it will either get shuffled back into the deck or replaced with the next round's ability card.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Below is what I think would be useful to add, but it needs to be confirmed first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When do conditions/effects that have duration start and stop?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For players&lt;/b&gt;, unless otherwise specified, conditions take effect until the end of your next turn.  Thus if a condition (eg, immobilize) is applied to you prior to your initiative, it is in effect during your entire turn, and is removed when your turn ends.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However if a condition (eg, invisibility) is applied to you during your turn, unless otherwise specified  it is in effect during the remainder of your turn, and remains in effect until the end of your next turn (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/20730915#20730915&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/20730915#20730915&lt;/a&gt;).  This applies to conditions such as strengthen as well (R2 rules, page 23)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, a condition that is present at the start of your turn is removed at the end of your turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;For monsters&lt;/b&gt;, effects that are on their stat card are always active.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effects that are on their action card take effect when their initiative arises.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If there is no token for tracking that condition/effect (eg retaliate), it remains in effect until the end of that round, and goes away when the action card is discarded.  If there are tokens for tracking that condition (eg, strengthen), then it goes away at the end of the monsters next turn (and thus might affect attacks for two turns). (ref R2 rules P23)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that on the monster action card, things are applied in the order presented, and thus for a hypothetical card with first line &quot;attack 2&quot; and second line &quot;strengthen&quot;, the strengthen would not happen until after the attack, and thus would apply only to the monsters next turn. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples:  if a monster has initiative 50 with shield 3 on their action card, and you hit them on initiative 30, they do not yet have a shield in place.   If they have shield 1 on their stat card, and have shield 3 on their action card (initiative 50), then if attacked before 50 they have shield 1, and after 50 they have shield 4 (since they stack).   (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25509580#25509580&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25509580#25509580&lt;/a&gt;).  There is no token for tracking shield, so at the end of the round, shield drops back to 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For conditions/effects that are applied by players onto monsters, the effect lasts until the end of the monsters next turn.   So if the monster has already acted this round, the condition will remain active the following round, through the end of his turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is this all correct?&lt;br/&gt;Do you agree it would be useful to add to the FAQ?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>Response to THECOSMICPOWER.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No rule for that. You lose one card from your discard pile and the rest go back into your hand. If you don't want to lose that particular card, you can suffer one damage to lose a different random card which can't be undone. That's it. </body>

			<body>That helps.  Would this then be correct (and much more concise)?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When do effects that have duration start and stop?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Conditions&lt;/b&gt; (for which there are tracking tokens) end as stated for the condition.  If a condition states it is active until the next turn, it is removed at the end of the figure's turn &lt;u&gt;if&lt;/u&gt; it started the turn with the condition.  Wound and poison have to be healed (and can both be removed with the same heal); if the heal is part of a long rest, they are in effect that round and are removed at initiative 99. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abilities&lt;/b&gt; (present on the monster stat card, eg, shield, retaliate) with duration are always present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus abilities&lt;/b&gt; (present on the monster action card, eg, shield, retaliate) with duration take effect at the monsters initiative, and are in effect for the rest of that round.    If such an ability is on both the stat card and the monster action card, it stacks during appropriate portions of that round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of this was not obvious to me (and likely others as well).  In particular, all users of gloomy companion may have missed the subtlety of whether shield/retaliate are on the stat card or the action card, since gloomy companion combines them.&lt;br/&gt;</body>

Or does it mean&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) the players decide which is stronger/weaker, and if they can't decide (while considering added effects as positive, but undefined), take the first card drawn?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As others already have pointed out, the correct answer is a).&lt;br/&gt;+0 muddle vs +2 stun is ambiguous and therefore the first modifier drawn is applied (see rulebook (2nd printing) p.21 top). Many players who have the game since the 1st printing know this b/c there were long threads on this issue already back then in which Isaac clarified this ruling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But I can definitely see how one could be confused by reading the FAQ (which usually takes precedence over the rulebook) which has in very close proximity the &quot;Advantage/Disadvantage&quot; and &quot;Ambiguous or Tied Situations&quot; rules without clarifying that the &quot;Ambiguous or Tied Situations&quot; rule doesn't apply to Advantage/Disadvantage. Maybe it would be good to add a point to &quot;Advantage/Disadvantage&quot; specifying that in this case (and only in this case) ambiguous doesn't mean &quot;players decide&quot; but rather that you have to use the first attack modifier drawn. </body>

			<body>I think it's quite unintuitive that +2 Stun is not clearly better than +0 muddle. But I guess the real question is: are there really attack modifier cards with +2 Stun or is this an academical example? </body>

But sometimes it'd be nice if there was a sign that says &quot;This is a zebra!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I searched (twice now), but can't find any of these old threads where Isaac issued a statement.

Without going in spoiler territory: A brute can encounter &quot;+1 Shield 1&quot; vs. &quot;+0 extra target&quot;, which is highly situational, but when viewed in &quot;real game context&quot; will usually be easy to tell which is better.</body>

I think a link to this list in the monster movement section of the FAQ and an entry into the community wiki could help a lot of players in understanding how the rules work on a practical level b/c it provides nicely constructed examples with solution, explanation and discussion for each example &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;.</body>

Would both the red and blue path in the image below qualify as a legitimate move?  The blue line is pretty clearly acceptable, but the red line is what has me questioning.  From the starting point to the end point, it’s a straight line, but you need to kind of zig-zag to get there which makes me think it’s probably not okay.  It just feels odd that you’re limited on what a straight line is simply due to the fact that you’re traveling through a hex-based map.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3909083"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/xbTdakzUwxQXgScXp1oOqUdEjpE=/fit-in/200x150/pic3909083.png" border=0></a></div>]]>[/o]&lt;br/&gt;</body>

If you're thinking of the movement as a line-of-sight projectile, then it's a straight line.  It's not maneuvering around obstacles, walls, etc.  In my mind, I can see that being a valid movement.  Thematically, it's like you're running at a full sprint, and if you're cutting at 90 degree angles in your path, you'd lose that momentum (and not be able to move that far).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically, if you have a path that goes from the first tile to the last tile without anything in the way (walls, enemies, obstacles), I can see that being a legitimate use of &quot;straight line&quot; movement.</body>

			<body>I see your point and I wish it were so. This is one of those gamey elements tho that hobble the action for the sake of game balance. The figure would in fact be Zig-Zaging from point A to point B changing directions many times before arriving. Moving straight on a hex layout can only be done in six directions.[o] Also, I'm pretty sure the intention of the action, just like any move action, is to allow you to move up to &quot;x&quot;. You could go 3, 4, 5...in a straight line.[/o]</body>

			<body>Apparently, stating it's not a summon makes people think that it's not a summon, and buffs to summons don't apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This can be avoided by a more concise wording.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ie.: (two mini spoiler again)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]Can you voluntarily remove the bear from the board?&lt;br/&gt;No (but the bear is considered a summon in all other regards)&lt;br/&gt;[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;aflorin wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My vote is to retire it so there aren't two things to maintain.

It also grabs the comments, which you may ignore, figure out  how to remove, or simply print what you want. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are other converters out there, this is the first I tried because it did not require me to sign up for something. Some folks have PDF making feature in Word or due to other installs on their computer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the FAQ changes over time, so be certain you want to print it! So a current PDF would be an added bit of work for anyone to maintain, in addition to the FAQ itself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks to Alex for his diligence in keeping it up.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

My group was playing a scenario where we had to track damage dealt [o]Scenario 54: Palace of Ice, and the Mindthief was the Seeker of Xorn[/o] and had a disagreement about whether this card's instant kill applied.  Half our group argued that the instant kill is the same as doing damage equal to the monster's hit points.  The other half said the instant kill (not the extra attacks on adjacent monsters) doesn't do damage at all.  The Mindthief wound up not using the ability, so it didn't matter, but it would be nice to know if instant kill abilities do &quot;damage&quot;.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDIT (so as not to further clutter the thread): Sorry aflorin! Thanks for the quick answer, Marcel!</body>

			<body>Outright killing is not the same as dealing damage. You need to perform attack actions that inflict the damage needed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greetings Marcel</body>

Any condition that's part of an attack has a positive but undefined value. So either could be &quot;better&quot;. It's hard, if not impossible to put a value on conditions because there are too many variables.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because Stun takes away the next action and Muddle just makes it a little worse? Not to mention that there's a +2  vs. a +0. There's no way this is intended and must be an error in the FAQ that nobody ever bothered to change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just ask yourself would you rather have a +2 to your attack AND Stun or get a +0 AND Muddle? There are precisely zero situations in which the latter is better.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: I finally found the post where Isaac gave an example where Muddle might be better. I guess my issue is with stating that they are ambiguous in the sense that one &quot;might&quot; be better in very limited contrived circumstances. In almost every &quot;in-game&quot; situation the +2 and Stun will be better than +0 and Muddle so don't take the ambiguous statement in the FAQ as a way to &quot;choose poorly&quot; just because of the FAQ but evaluate it for that situation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit 2: After reading more it seems that Isaac does intend for ALL instances of +2 and Stun vs +0 and Muddle (for example) to be ambiguous and we should treat ALL instances of extra conditions as an undefined positive number even when it's often clear in a given situation that one of those conditions is much &quot;better&quot; than another. I would prefer the rules not use the words &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; and instead made a blanket statement telling you to take the first card if both drawn cards have different conditions and be done with it. Using words like &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; are context dependent and cause confusion.</body>

			<body>I found this strange as well. From the above thread, I think it's not against the spirit of the game to play this differently. But remember that you have to play it the same under disadvantage. I think that Isaac wanted to give a very easy rule that wouldn't cause further discussion. </body>

I understand it can't end its turn in the same space as another figure (which is why I asked in the first place). But it can go through the trap and take the damage. But now that it's stunned/immobilized, where does it end up since it can't be in the same space as the trap due to the presence of the flying monster?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Or if you're saying it can't even enter the hex and trigger the trap due to the consequences of the trap, that seems really odd both rules-wise and thematically. How would it know in advance it was going to be stunned/immobilized? Seems more logical that the rule would be &quot;it gets stunned/immobilized, but then is shifted to the nearest empty hex (player's choice if ambiguous)&quot;. </body>

			<body>Has there been a statement from Isaac (I don't see it specifically in the FAQ) about what to do in the situation mentioned here &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1917762/advantagedisadvantage-ambiguity&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1917762/advantagedisadvanta...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That thread got derailed but nobody was able to give a definitive answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In short, do you consider effects that are not on the attack modifier cards when determining which card is &quot;better&quot; or if it is &quot;ambiguous&quot;? For example, The attack itself has Muddle and with advantage you draw the +0 Muddle and +2 Stun (which is ambiguous per the FAQ). Are we to consider the Muddle from the attack or should we ONLY look at the attack modifier cards? Similarly, what if the monster being attacked already had the Muddle condition, would we disregard the Muddle on the card as you can't Muddle it again?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It seems the FAQ as written would say that these situations are still &quot;ambiguous&quot; as we aren't supposed to make decisions based on game state. The spirit of the rules, however, seems to revolve around making sure the players don't need to ever debate &quot;better&quot; and &quot;worse&quot;. In these cases, there is no debate as Muddle from the modifier card has value zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thoughts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>Can you point me in the right direction? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I can't find that statement in either RAW or FAQ (and believe me, I've tried)!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The assumption that it's there (or the difficulty I've had in finding it) is precisely why I feel it should be added to the advantage/disadvantage section.</body>

			<body>The rules tell you to consider numerical attack modifiers, added effects provided from attack modifier cards and how to deal with rolling cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They &lt;b&gt;don't&lt;/b&gt; tell you to consider abilities. Just like they &lt;b&gt;don't&lt;/b&gt; tell you to consider class, positioning or time of day.&lt;br/&gt;The whole FAQ section on dis-/advantage ambiguity is based on the question &quot;...how do I determine whether one attack modifier card is better or worse &lt;b&gt;in the case of effects beyond the typical +/- modifiers?&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effects beyond the typical +/- modifiers covers... well, everything else. Like: abilities, class, positioning and time of day. The example case of +2 stun vs. +0 muddle is a pitch perfect example on how the rules deal with &quot;better or worse decisions&quot; that would be based on the game state: You choose the first card drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: On re-reading, I noticed this may come across as snarky. Snark is not intended, I was being jokesy.&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>From the rulebook, page 20:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;When attacking, the base attack value written on the card can be modified by three types of values in the&lt;br/&gt;following order. Repeat these steps for each individual enemy targeted by the attack:&lt;br/&gt;• An attacker’s attack modifiers are applied first. These modifiers include bonuses and penalties from&lt;br/&gt;active ability cards, items, and other sources (e.g., +1 Attack from POISON).&lt;br/&gt;• Next, an attack modifier card is drawn from the attacker’s attack modifier deck and applied.&lt;br/&gt;• Lastly, the defender’s defensive bonuses are applied. This reduces the incoming attack value for each&lt;br/&gt;individual enemy targeted based on each defender’s own shield modifier or other defensive bonuses.&lt;br/&gt;• If there are multiple modifiers in any single step of this process, the player chooses the order in which&lt;br/&gt;they are applied. Also note that because the bonuses are applied per target, it is possible for the same&lt;br/&gt;attack action to ultimately deal different damage to each enemy it targets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if the target was already poisoned (not being poisoned by the attack), the +1 attack from POISON would be applied first, then you apply the x2 card drawn.</body>

It literally says that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, but the question is whether effects on cards that are nullified by the rules (because statuses don't stack) count. As a point of comparison, the monster AI rules involve ranged enemies moving away from their targets to lose disadvantage, and in that case the ruling is that they only do so if they are not currently muddled. It's not obvious to me why these cases are treated differently, and it doesn't &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to be obvious, but I see the value of explicitly mentioning it. It does seem like it's a &quot;frequently-asked question&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>As Kenny suggests above, there is still some room for confusion. (His suggested wording wouldn't work because you DO consider the attack strength when x2 is drawn).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So,[BGCOLOR=#99FF66] Does an &quot;&lt;i&gt;added effect&lt;/i&gt;&quot; (the consistently-used wording) exist &lt;i&gt;if no effect would be added&lt;/i&gt;?[/BGCOLOR]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully, phrasing the question in this way illustrates why there is some ambiguity still possible.</body>

If many people misinterpret it (as evidenced by so many topics about it) then perhaps a change is warranted. I'm not saying what's written is not correct, but if there is still confusion from so many people I don't see how clearing it up absolutely in a way impossible to misinterpret could possibly be a bad thing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You could write the word &quot;card&quot; a hundred times but the word &quot;better&quot; has an ingrained meaning to people as &quot;choose better result&quot; and a single sentence could dispel that notion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, my earlier sentence would also need the caveat that the x2 card does need to consider the attack strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It does still seem strange that an effect that absolutely can not be added to a target still counts as an undefined positive modifier but I'll use that ruling unless there's something further from Isaac about it.</body>

			<body>How about this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I have advantage or disadvantage, how do I determine whether one attack modifier card is better or worse in the case of effects on the card beyond the typical +/- modifiers? How do I know when a comparison of the cards is ambiguous?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All effects listed on the card (negative conditions, elements, healing, etc.) have a positive but undefined value. Note that only the values and effects as listed on the cards are considered when doing a comparison - no other game effects or conditions should be considered. Thus, these would be the rulings in the following cases:&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>I think that would work beautifully. The x2 card is a bit of an aberration but I think is still okay as to consider the x2 effect you are explicitly instructed to use attack strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks!</body>

			<body>Another idea that Willicotta came up with in another thread. They used the term &quot;mathematical ambiguity&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I really like it, since it serves the function of differing dis-/advantage ambiguity from general/tactical ambiguity. It makes clear that we should only be considering the math, and since you can't mathematically convert stun to muddle, it also explains why effects are ambiguous.&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>We ran into a bit of an ambiguous situation today, with our first retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prospective retiree had personal goal 529, but I would not be surprised if the same applies to other personal goals. I'll put the rest in spoiler tags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]I don't have the card in front of me, but it went something like this &quot;Do two scenarios in the Lingering Swamp, then unlock 'The Fading Lightouse' (scenario 61) and follow it to a conclusion.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, at the end of this scenario (just like every other scenario) you get &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; conclusion, and a breadcrumb to a new scenario. We were not certain as to whether the scenario conclusion itself was enough, or whether we needed something else as well. We spent a few minutes trying to find an answer, but couldn't find anything until I looked ahead at the rewards for the next scenario and saw that completing the goal and unlocking the new box was part of the reward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't know if anyone else has had this issue, and I don't know whether the issue was particular to this one scenario/goal, but I think it could use some clarification. Maybe something along the lines of &quot;If a personal goal tells you to follow a scenario to a conclusion, the goal is not fulfilled until you get a reward telling you it is.&quot;[/o]</body>

But it is not clear from the rulebook and the printed card. The card says &quot;follow it to a conclusion.&quot; At the end of the scenario, there is &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; conclusion. It even says &quot;Conclusion&quot; in the scenario book, just as it does in every other scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This did not &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; right to us, which is why we went looking for an answer online, starting with the FAQ. We didn't find anything that said one way or the other, until we skipped ahead and looked at the rewards for the second scenario, which settled the issue. But it could be clearer that the conclusion called for is explicitly stated as a reward, not just the conclusion of the scenario listed on the personal quest card.</body>

It was actually that you CAN'T grind the same scenario. There is even a FAQ entry about it for the applicable scenarios.</body>

			<body>You can rotate it any way you want, making a total of 6 possibilities (12 if you count the hexes rotated 90º as another configuration). For the example on page 21, here are the possible orientations with the hexes aligned as in the example. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img border=0 src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/SRa5r2D.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</body>

			<body>There are some questions about how jump movement is handled for the AI when they can’t reach their destination that turn in a couple of threads. Probably worth adding once there’s a clear resolution.

			<body>I'm a little confused how range/distance is affected by walls, so some clarification please on the following!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an enemy is on the other side of this one-dimensional wall line from me, can I hit him with a melee attack?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not with a non-AoE meele attack. All range, even range 1 melee attacks, can't be counted through walls. In fact, for all intents and purposes (including looting), these two hexes are not adjacent and considered two hexes apart. Note that AoE Melee attacks use their diagram (not adjancency) to determine if a target is in range.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does the 'these two hexes are not adjacent and considered two hexes apart' apply to monster focus/movement too?  If not you end up with a case where a monster may stay put if it has move 1 and the focus'd character is on the opposite side of the wall, but not adjacent to it as moving into the doorway will not move it any closer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;The following image shows the range (4 red hexes) between a source and a target. The blue line shows their LOS.&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3872492"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/Eja0WOxMwf17Uj05vu-EGhVLUiI=/fit-in/200x150/pic3872492.jpg" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if S only has range 3, they can not attack T?  This seems a little odd, as the LoS using the right hand vertices is clear of the wall itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks (and for putting together the thread)!</body>

			<body>When monsters move, do they always try to follow the same path that they traced while determining their focus? This path may sometimes result in them not moving at all if they are jumping. Will they use a different path if the focus path would result in them not moving and if it gets them closer to their focus?</body>

			<body>It will move to a hex that is nearest to hex from which it can attack, assuming it will always be able to jump. So in your case it will try to move to place from which way will be shorter.</body>

			<body>I asked for more clarification from Isaac. Here is his response:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If a monster has a jump, it considers all obstacles/enemies/traps as if they were allies (i.e. something they can move through but not end their move on). And then follow the movement rules from there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'll update the FAQ accordingly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I interpreted his ruling differently. Sorry about that.</body>

			<body>Regarding multi-target attacks: it might be clearer to separate additional target selection out into two steps, like this (assuming I’ve interpreted it correctly):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Attacking its primary focus, losing disadvantage if possible&lt;br/&gt;2) Attacking as many other targets as possible&lt;br/&gt;3) If there is a choice between different groups of equally many targets to attack, attacking targets in priority order according to the focus rules from its starting position&lt;br/&gt;4) Avoiding disadvantage on as many of the additional targets as possible (equal priority)&lt;br/&gt;5) Moving as little as possible to attack the chosen set of targets&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This makes it clearer that a monster will always choose three targets (assuming one is its focus and it does not have disadvantage on that attack) over two, even if the two-target attack would hit its second priority target and the three-target attack does not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, there appears to be a bold tag closed incorrectly near the updated section on monster movement with jump.</body>

			<body>Hmm, yeah I see the point. The rules prioritize maximizing the number of targets. The Focus tie breaker was a ruling in case there were multiple options of extra targets. The FAQ should reflect that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How about this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st - Attack its primary focus, losing disadvantage if possible&lt;br/&gt;2nd - Attack as many extra targets as possible&lt;br/&gt;3rd - If there are multiple attack locations with an equal number of different extra targets, use the focus rules (from its starting position) to determine priority&lt;br/&gt;4rd - Lose disadvantage on the extra targets (all equal priority, players decide ties)&lt;br/&gt;5th - Move as little as possible to attack the chosen targets</body>

			<body>Can an entry be added to the FAQ clarifying special abilities for bosses?  I originally interpreted the combination of rules on pg. 32 concerning boss special abilities and on pg. 9 concerning the persistence of monster special traits to mean that a boss does its special abilities every turn.  I did not know there were &quot;Special X&quot; cards in the boss ability deck and nowhere does it say those cards exist.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A simple addition to the FAQ that says &quot;Bosses only perform their special abilities when specifically instructed to do so through an ability card&quot; would have been extremely helpful.  Ultimately it's an error that you only make once and, if you are going to make it, you'll make it by scenario 2, but this would have saved me and I'm sure others many minutes of game time spent going in the wrong direction and could potentially cause you to have to just restart the whole damn scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just a suggestion.  Thanks.</body>

			<body>I haven't been able to find any official answer to this and I'm not sure it has one yet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Where items may only be used on a single-target attack, does this refer solely to the attack action as written on the card, or does it include any other known modifiers that also add a target? Can more than one such item be used at once?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See this thread for discussion:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1940918/what-comes-first-item-legality-check-or-ability-mo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1940918/what-comes-first-it...&lt;/a&gt;</body>

			<body>Need a little clarification on one part of the FAQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do those term mean?&lt;br/&gt;An &lt;b&gt;action &lt;/b&gt;is the top half or bottom half of an ability card (or the full card for monsters), or an item or persistent ability that specifically says it grants an &quot;action&quot;. An ability that grants another figure an out-of-turn ability (like move or attack) is not an action unless it says &quot;action&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An attack action is an action that has an attack in it. It constitutes any and all attacks made with that specific action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the &lt;b&gt;action &lt;/b&gt;contains separate &quot;attack&quot; lines, all are part of the attack action. If the attack is an AoE, all attacks performed as part of the AoE are part of the attack action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It says that an action is one half part of a card. All of it.&lt;br/&gt;Its says after that if an ACTION has separate attack lines then all are part of the attack action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then if I have this card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;attack 2&lt;br/&gt;move 2&lt;br/&gt;attack 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and use a minor power potion (+1 to entire attack action) and if I understand well it is now a &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attack 3&lt;br/&gt;move 2&lt;br/&gt;attack 4 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;?&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>Advantage/disadvantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;as long as you considerate nothing else apart the cards drawn. Which is better between x2 and +x.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;x2 is a positive underminated value ? And then should be considerate as a +0 x2 just like a +0 stun. And then it is ambiguous.&lt;br/&gt;x2 is always better (even if it is not) ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;what about x2 vs +0 stun ?</body>

			<body>I just found &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1687146/article/25752513#25752513&quot;   &gt;this answer from Isaac&lt;/a&gt; (link to post in old FAQ thread, spoilers marked) which states that actions cannot interrupt other actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FAQ already clarifies that &lt;b&gt;items&lt;/b&gt; can't initiate actions during other actions, but doesn't make the larger claim. Is this ruling still current? If so, it should be in the FAQ, perhaps under the section that defines what an &quot;action&quot; is.</body>

			<body>Hi, I hope this is right place for these questions.  I either cannot find an answer in the rulebook, or I am not sure how to interpret the rules.&lt;br/&gt;1.	On p.44 ‘Levelling Up’ it says “… add one new card to their ACTIVE card pool …“, on p.45 ‘Building a Hand of Cards’ it says “… select a number of cards from the character AVAILABLE card pool …”.  The only other place where I can find ACTIVE being mentioned is with the player mat card placement reference; is there a difference between 'ACTIVE’ and ‘AVAILABLE’ in this case or is this a stylistic variation?&lt;br/&gt;2.	When a character with an undefined attack value (i.e. -) has its turn, can it draw cards from the modifier deck?  Thus possibly triggering a condition or effect?&lt;br/&gt;3.	Presuming there might be non-player characters that have ‘attack 0’ (I have not been playing long so I don’t know if such a character exists.), would turning up the 2x modifier be treated as a null and the modifier deck reshuffled?&lt;br/&gt;4.	Was it intended that when a player character dies their summons disappear, while when monsters die their summons persist?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

When going on mission you choose as much card as your character let you from that pool (all lvl 1, all lvl x and all card you've put in your pool by leveling).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. if the attack is undefined he don't draw any modifier card because he cannot attack. Unless he is granted an &quot;attack x&quot; (and not an attack +x) action. Therefore, he will draw a modifier card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. 0 * 2 = 0.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. You could see players summons like a psychic bound while ennemies summons are more physicals apparition from another plan of existance &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;</body>

			<body>I have a question in which the wording in the rules is unclear &lt;b&gt;given the clarification of terms in the FAQ&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The question is, if a multi-target attack has Push/Pull, does Push (or Pull) resolve after each attack, &lt;b&gt;before&lt;/b&gt; resolving other attacks (i.e. before drawing modifiers), or do you resolve all attacks and then apply push/pull to each target?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This thread has a bit of a discussion going on about it: &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1944942/multi-target-attacks-and-attack-order&quot;   &gt;Multi-target attacks and attack order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a quote from the rules:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules pg. 22 wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;If an attack effect is listed on an ability card after an attack, the target (or targets) of the attack is subject to the additional effect as well, after damage from the attack is resolved.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And from the FAQ:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FAQ under Player Abilities wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;An attack is a single attack on a single target that flips over a single attack modifier card.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Certainly, they seem to contradict each other because of the bracketed &quot;(or targets)&quot; in the rules which implies that an attack (not an attack action) can have multiple targets.</body>

			<body>When looking at the ambiguity rules of advantage, I saw this one:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;+0 Muddle vs +2 Stun: Ambiguous&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isn't this strange? I would consider stun &amp;gt; disarm &amp;gt; muddle. But this was ruled differently. These are all positive but undefined. I might assume these undefined values are equal. In that case should +2 stun still not be the best choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't think I would remember this case when I would have to make this choice. I would take the +2 stun straight away.</body>

			<body>The undefined values are not equal, nor are any one of them greater than any of the others. That's part of the definition of &quot;undefined.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We can come up with specific situations in which a +0 Muddle is better than a +2 Stun. It's been done. For that reason, those two are considered ambiguous, and you resolve the attack accordingly.</body>

All added effects are considered to have an undefined positive value and hence cards will be ambiguous if added effects are ever different (because 2+x is not always more than 0+y even if in almost all cases you would want the former).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't like the rule but it has been clarified by the designer to work that way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many groups houserule it and I'd guess that people that don't visit these forums will play it as choose the best/worst for each situation as it is a more intuitive way of interpreting the rulebook statement.</body>

With a full custom triforce character deck, advantages and disadvantages ends 70% of the time the same way... take the first card drawn &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even if it is a good thing to point this out, it is also true that it's not the place for this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So yeah dobbelB that's silly so if you don't like playing silly head to the variant section \o/ &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;</body>

			<body>FAQ Update&lt;br/&gt;----------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added entries to general Abilities section:&lt;br/&gt; - Multiple attacks from the same ability are NOT resolved simultaneously&lt;br/&gt; - If an ability says &quot;Do X to do Y&quot;, you always get to do Y, regardless of the results of X&lt;br/&gt; - If an ability has a conditional bonus, you evaluate the condition before you do the ability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scenario 21&lt;br/&gt;  - Added typo correction. The demons are ordered incorrectly in the book&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lightning Class&lt;br/&gt;  - Added clarification to several cards (319, 320, 324, 331)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Resting&lt;br/&gt;  - You can chose not to get the heal or refresh items in a Long Rest, but you still must discard a card and put the rest in your hand.&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>Alex, 2 things regarding the new Lightning FAQ entries:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]1.The &quot;Numb the Pain&quot; entry is contrary to Isaac's ruling. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;He writes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cephalofair wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color=#0B5C0D&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Numb the pain, bottom:&lt;/b&gt; if you exhausy yourself with the dmg your exhausted first and don't get to stun anyone. If there is no enemy present, you don't get to take the damage. If they are immune to stun, it should still be ok. Lime attacking a enemy with shield 4 with aan atk 1. It doesn't matter that it won't do anything.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first sentence here is incorrect. You would stun the enemy (if it can be stunned). If an ability says &quot;do X to do Y,&quot; those effects happen simultaneously. Note, however, that if the &quot;Y&quot; part is getting a bonus to an ability like an attack or a move, if you exhaust yourself, you don't get to then attack or move. You resolve applying the bonus first (which is where you would take the damage and possibly get exhausted), and then take the action (if you aren't exhausted).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other parts of this answer are correct.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The relevant part here that the FAQ has wrong is that you &lt;b&gt;can't&lt;/b&gt; use the ability without an adjacent enemy to target. (Also relevant and perhaps worth mentioning: you get the stun even if you exhaust yourself.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. I request adding an entry for break the chains at level 2 as I don't think the ruling is obvious due to how other ways of affecting move actions work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cephalofair wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elements can be consumed at any point, yes, but conditional bonuses to abilities like these should be resolved and applied before the ability takes place. Thus, any damage or healing that you take during your movement would not affect the bonus.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the ruling is something like: &quot;HP is checked before you start moving, so it doesn't matter if your HP goes up or down during the move (for example due to hazardous terrain).&quot;[/o]</body>

So if during the move something negates X, you still get the +2 move bonus.</body>

			<body>According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28406846#28406846&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; thread, items with summon on them might need clarification/errata:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cards doesn't state that summoning counts as an action, so they are usable while perfoming other actions.&lt;br/&gt;This can be very relevant for flanking based classes:&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Move Attack&quot; abilities could be used to move in range, drop a summon to set up a flank and then gain flank boni during the action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is that intended?</body>

			<body>Question on moving monsters and allies:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* When the monster selects its focus, does line of sight matter?&lt;br/&gt;   - IE.   Monster is in a room and directly in its line of sight is the tinker - 3 hexes away.   Around the corner is the brute - equal distance away - and has a lower initiative number.   Would the monster focus on and thus move toward the tinker (because it can see it) or would it move toward the brute?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* same question for summons - does the summon have to have LOS in order to determine which enemy it moves toward.&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>If a monster dies on a hex that already has a money token, does the monster drop a 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) money token? Said differently, are money tokens only dropped on empty hexes or are they the exception to the general rule that nothing (summons, spawns, traps etc.) can be placed on an hex that is not empty? The consensus seems to be that because the RAW do not say the hex must be empty, then an additional money token does spawn.</body>

			<body>The FAQ entry on this is pretty vague:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FAQ wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I perform a Loot even if there is no Loot in range?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think you could make the argument that with Pilfer, if there is an enemy in range, then there &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; loot in range. Admittedly, this is a thematic argument and from a purely mechanical standpoint, I guess you're right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the other hand, Pilfer does say &quot;Gain one &lt;b&gt;additional&lt;/b&gt; money token from the supply...&quot; which could imply that you would have already had to have gained a money token from the Loot action.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one might need clarification. </body>

			<body>I have a general complaint about the structure of the FAQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I just came across this thread regarding fulfilling retirement conditions, returning to gloomhaven, and then un-fulfilling the retirement conditions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1952434/question-about-personal-quest-512-spoilers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1952434/question-about-pers...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In it, the following bit from the rulebook is cited:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;If a character currently fulfills the conditions of his or her personal quest and is visiting Gloomhaven, the character must announce retirement. &lt;br/&gt;The character may perform any other town activities beforehand, but he or she cannot play any new scenarios using a character with a fulfilled personal quest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;as well as this bit from the FAQ:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I fulfill the conditions of my personal quest and then do something so that they are no longer fulfilled, do I still retire?&lt;br/&gt;No, you must be fulfilling the conditions of your personal quest at the time you retire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I read these two together, what I get from it is that the FAQ is obviously not talking about doing so in Gloomhaven, because the rulebook explicitly says that you must retire and may perform other activities in gloomhaven beforehand. I assumed that the FAQ is only talking about if you meet retirement conditions outside of gloomhaven and then that changes before you return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alex Florin in the linked thread says this is not correct; the FAQ entry overrides the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's my belief that when a FAQ entry is supposed to override the rulebook, it should explicitly say so. One option for this is to label it &quot;errata&quot;. Another is to just specifically mention the rulebook section that the FAQ entry overrules. In the absence of either of those, it makes sense for a reader to take FAQ entries only as clarifications where the rulebook is unclear or people are often confused, rather than providing genuinely new information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In theory, it should be enough to read the rulebook and the errata. An FAQ's purpose is to be a central repository to look for help &lt;b&gt;when you have a question&lt;/b&gt;, not to be required reading material for playing the game correctly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also other FAQ entries that I think should be listed as errata, as distinguished from &quot;frequently asked questions&quot;. For example, &quot;If an item grants an action, it cannot be used in the middle of another action&quot; is nowhere to be found in the rulebook. That is in no way a frequently asked question. No one would even think to ask it, because that rule is not present in the rulebook.</body>

So I've always assumed that the goal of amassing questions into an FAQ was that ultimately, everything in the FAQ would be folded in to a new version of the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So as this FAQ keeps growing, I keep looking forward to a new rulebook and resetting the FAQ back to 0. &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But I'm clearly wrong on this because some games actually come with an FAQ printed in the initial rulebook! That seems silly to me. Especially when the things in the FAQ are actually answered in the rulebook, which I've sometimes seen, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, if the Gloomhaven FAQ says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Q: Can I change the order of the abilities in an Action?&lt;br/&gt;A: No, any abilities that you choose not to skip must be performed in the order listed on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think that means that the actual rulebook mistakenly doesn't explicitly say that the actions have to be performed in order. So the next step would be to update the rulebook and delete that question from the FAQ.</body>

			<body>many of the FAQ entries are about rarely occuring fringe cases and/or how advanced abilities/items interact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nobody wants to slog through all of those when they are first learning the game.  (heck, it seems many people can't even be bothered to slog through the rulebook as it is).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is useful purpose to have an FAQ separate from the rulebook.  Now if the designer wants to include an FAQ section in future printings of the rulebook, so that there was a rules section that covers the basics of gameplay that players should read prior to beginning play, and then a reference section of official rulings on how the intricacies of certain ability interactions should be handled, that would be good too.  But it doesn't all need to be incorporated into the general rules.</body>

			<body>Maybe getting rid of the FAQ isn't the answer, but I do think that many of the items would be good to fold in to the actual rulebook instead of living permanently in an FAQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fact that these questions are asked frequently means that the rulebook isn't doing a good enough job.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I agree that infrequently asked questions/corner cases/advanced interactions probably don't belong in the day-to-day rulebook, but maybe in a section of their own called &quot;Advanced Topics&quot;.</body>

			<body>I'm on board with updating the rules, but I also think there's a place for a frequantly asked questions document that's technically redundant with the rulebook. The purpose is just to be more efficient at getting answers to common questions out there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMO, here's an example of a good FAQ entry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I an ally of myself?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This question is frequently asked. It's included in the rulebook, but people looking for the answer of &quot;what is an ally&quot; might have a hard time guessing where to find it in there. As such, they frequently ask it. So here it is.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another good example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it ever possible to do damage with an attack after the &quot;no damage&quot; attack modifier card or Curse card takes effect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. If this card is applied to your attack, you do no attack damage with the attack under any circumstances. Note that additional effects, including non-attack damage ones, still take place.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a good FAQ entry because it clarifies two rules in the rulebook that kind of contradict each other in the situation where you draw a rolling +1 and then a null:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;A “Null” symbol means that no damage is done by the attack.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;If there are multiple modifiers in any single step of this process, the player chooses the order in which&lt;br/&gt;they are applied.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Someone reading the rulebook might ask: do the rules really mean &quot;no damage is done by the attack&quot;? Or do they mean reduce the damage to zero&quot;? It's relevant because you can choose to apply the null first, and then the +1 after. If you're not sure if you should take the rule literally (no damage is done, even though you added 1 later), you can check the FAQ and see that yes, you should. But this doesn't need to be added to the rules, because it's already there. But it's helpful to call out specifically anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here's a borderline case:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a character has initiative 99 and another is doing a long rest (which is treated as initiative 99), which one goes first in the round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The character doing the long rest goes later.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook doesn't mention this case. It says to tiebreak on second card, and players decide if still tied. This gives a clear but not entirely satisfying answer: players choose who goes first, because there wasn't a second card to tiebreak on. But that's wrong, according to the FAQ. You can sort of argue that the FAQ is clarifying a case that the rulebook didn't cover, but actually the rulebook did cover it along with every other ambiguous case by saying that the players decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an example of something I'd like to be added to the rulebook if the designer really wants it to be a rule. But at the same time, it's so minor, and the fact that it contradicts and overrules the rulebook is unmistakable. So, I don't mind this not being labeled &quot;errata&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt; - If an item grants an action, it cannot be used in the middle of another action&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This FAQ entry is completely new. There's no way to read the rules and come to this conclusion. It should be marked as errata and added to the rulebook.</body>

It's an outright correction to the Rulebook.</body>

			<body>I need to follow up on some of these questions but generally speaking, the FAQ shouldn't contradict the rules, and if it does, I agree it should be considered an errata. I don't know if an extension to a rule should be but I can see it argued both ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do know that Isaac is hesitant to classify items as errata unless they specifically replace or change a rule and those are very, very rare. An extension to a rule is another matter to him (I think).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if an entry looks like it contradicts a rule, it needs to be brought to our attention so we can deal with it (most probably by rewording the FAQ unless the actual rule is wrong and there have been very few cases of the those).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That said, I think the important thing is that the intended text is included in the FAQ, whether it is an errata section or elsewhere.</body>

			<body>These are some great examples!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SevenSpirits wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#0B5C0D&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Am I an ally of myself?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This question is frequently asked. It's included in the rulebook, but people looking for the answer of &quot;what is an ally&quot; might have a hard time guessing where to find it in there. As such, they frequently ask it. So here it is.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That just makes me think that the rulebook could be better organized. If there is information in the rulebook and people &lt;i&gt;frequently&lt;/i&gt; can't find it, that information is just not in the right spot(s).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SevenSpirits wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Another good example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#0B5C0D&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it ever possible to do damage with an attack after the &quot;no damage&quot; attack modifier card or Curse card takes effect?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. If this card is applied to your attack, you do no attack damage with the attack under any circumstances.

Note that additional effects, including non-attack damage ones, still take place,&lt;/b&gt;&quot; that would majorly cut down the frequency of that question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's what I mean about taking the FAQ answers and incorporating them into the actual rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I also really like examples in rulebooks. If an FAQ has to do with a common rolling modifier question that people have, that would be great to incorporate as an example in the section that explains rolling modifiers.</body>

			<body>I've been think about the errata question and layout suggestions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although the organizer/ocd part of me likes the idea, it would take me quite a while (and probably would be of limited value for the effort) to go through every entry, check them against the rule book, and label them as &quot;clarification&quot;, &quot;rule addition&quot;, &quot;errata&quot;, etc. It would also be kind of subjective and I don't want the thread to turn into a bunch of discussions about these classifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do agree that being able to know that an entry is an actual rule change is useful. But one of the reasons I didn't want to move the one or two other entries that qualify into the current Errata section is because I think it is more useful for search and reading to have them in their own applicable sub-sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, if memory serves, the original FAQ's errata section actually read &quot;Major Errata&quot;, implying that at least some minor errata was sprinkled through the entries. So how about this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I remove the Errata heading completely and move those entries to other appropriate (maybe new) sections. Then I tag ONLY those entries, and the one or two others that also qualify, as &quot;errata&quot;. We can have discussions about whether an entry should be considered an errata or not but at least this gives us the ability to mark them that way and still have them be in appropriate sub-sections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for which entries qualify as errata, my gut reaction is to limit them to actual rule changes. An entry that clarifies an ambiguous or non-defined edge case from the rule book or one that adds a rule not in the rule book wouldn't be tagged as such though you could argue that the latter is also errata.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'll ping Isaac on this since he has the final word of course.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thoughts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PS. When the 2nd edition of the rule book came out, we tried to incorporate the FAQ entries at the time into that revision. I'm sure the same thing will happen for new entries if a 3rd edition of the rule book is printed.</body>

			<body>Hi Alex,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this forum we had a discussion about the large XP symbol in player's cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28481616#28481616&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28481616#28481616&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;u&gt;FROM FAQ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can I play a card just for the experience?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have to perform at least one part of the action on the card to gain the experience. If it just says &quot;Attack,&quot; you have to attack an enemy to get the experience. If it has &quot;Attack&quot; and &quot;Move,&quot; however, you can just move and not attack and still get the experience. &lt;b&gt;A larger experience symbol sitting on its own on an action is not meant to be tied to any specific ability in the action.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the sentence in bold is needed a better wording as to not be confusing when the large XP symbol is sitting near an ability.&lt;br/&gt;The result is that players believe the XP is tied to the ability, that is near the XP symbol, and not the whole half action of the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 'sitting on its own', that is in bold in the FAQ might not be clear enough, because for example in CRATER card of Gragheart, the large XP symbol is not on it's own but near the Move ability.</body>

So if your personal quest is 'have 8 items'*, you can't sell them back when you retire - they're out of the game forever?  Because the way that 'errata' is written as soon as you sell one you can no longer retire.   Also consider if there's one for having money - no donations or enhancements for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* As far as I know this is not an exact quest, but is close enough to make my point.</body>

So if your personal quest is 'have 8 items'*, you can't sell them back when you retire - they're out of the game forever?  Because the way that 'errata' is written as soon as you sell one you can no longer retire.   Also consider if there's one for having money - no donations or enhancements for you!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* As far as I know this is not an exact quest, but is close enough to make my point.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are not out of the game forever. When you retire all your items go back to the store.</body>

			<body>Interesting, I hadn't considered the interpretation that &quot;announcing retirement&quot; is just another term for retiring. &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/laugh.gif&quot; alt=&quot;laugh&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My reading of that sentence is that you are required to &lt;b&gt;announce retirement&lt;/b&gt;, whatever that means, the moment you're in Gloomhaven and meet the conditions, but that you may then perform any other town activities before &lt;b&gt;retiring&lt;/b&gt;.</body>

			<body>&lt;br/&gt;Alex, could you please take a look at the following thread, because this is a question that keeps popping up:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1954199/ranged-movement-clarification-discrepancy-between&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1954199/ranged-movement-cla...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FAQ isn't clear about the prioritization in movement rules of monsters with ranged attack that can't attack this turn. Will a monster choose a &lt;b&gt;longer path&lt;/b&gt; in order to avoid disadvantage in a future turn? The same question applies to maximizing additional targets.</body>

			<body>Monsters don't plan ahead. They move as close as they can to try and attack.&lt;br/&gt;Moving away to prevent disadvantage only comes into play once they are in range to attack a player, and have movement left.&lt;br/&gt;</body>

Is this ruling still current?

			<body>Alex could you add a few more examples to the Advantage/Disadvantage section of the FAQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;2x and Attack 2 vs +3: +3 is better&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;2x and Attack 2 vs +2 stun: +2 stun is better&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And possibly change &lt;br/&gt;&quot;2x and Attack 2 vs +2: 2x is better&quot;&lt;br/&gt;to&lt;br/&gt;&quot;2x and Attack 2 vs +2: Ambiguous&quot;&lt;br/&gt;because both options result in the same result and neither is better than the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This would clarify that 2x is not inherently better than +2 but it all depends on the attack value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is all based on &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28343237#28343237&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28343237#28343237&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDIT&lt;br/&gt;Or maybe even add a clarification that &quot;2x&quot; should be replaced with attack value for comparison purpose only.</body>

This heal can remove wound and poison like any other heal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to heal modifiers stacking, I think the wording for &lt;i&gt;Any time&lt;/i&gt; above should be changed to state that once drawing from the attack modifier deck concludes.  Although the exact wording may depend on the conclusion of &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1956958/healing-modifier-healing-action&quot;   &gt;Is Healing Modifier a healing “action”&lt;/a&gt;.

			<body>In regards to scenario 20 boss...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scenario book and the FAQ say that special 1 and 2 are the same (just a different monster summoned). But the boss stat card has move and attack on special 2 in addition to the summon mechanic (making them not the same at all). Is the stat card correct (with 1 bones/corpse and attack/move)? Or the book specials correct (2 summons bones/corpse with no move/attack). Or is it both summon 2 (and move and attack on special 2)??</body>

This is the full special to apply when a &quot;special&quot; card is drawn. However, the scenario book just clarify the number of monsters summoned for each special.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that on the stat card it says &lt;br/&gt;[o]summon living bone&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maybe it is possible to face the same boss in alternative scenario. Even though they will always sumon the same type of monster, the number summoned and their quality (normal elite) may change. Or it is only a space saver because it is impossible to put all the description on the stat cards and ask the player to refer to the scenario book to know what means &lt;br/&gt;[o]summon living bone&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;[/o]</body>

			<body>That is how we played it, but the wording in the book is poor. Also my problem is with the book having less info than the stat card which makes no sense. Things should be spelled out more in the book, not less. “Same” either needs to have “summon” after it or be taken out. Hence my posting in the FAQ response page...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Your second part is not helpful, the first monster is plural because it’s name is plural (and has to do with the components of said monster not number of said monsters), the second monster is singular on the stat card because the monster’s name is singular... </body>

But what I wanted to say is that the stat card doesn't say any numeric value. It is undefined. It just say you have to summon some monsters from a certain type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now you just have to look on the scenario book the number and quality of monster because it depends of number of player (impossible to put this info on the stat cards and like I said maybe a boss can be encountered in multiple scenario with difference in number and quality of monsters summoned).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the rule book can't held more infos because special action could depend of the scenario level. Don't know if there is really differences since I don't have the stat card with men but it could be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In fact, there is no need to put again all numerical values on the scenario book as long the stat card is there for this. And it is spacely impossible to put the number and quality of monsters summons on the stat card since it depends of the number of players.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, ok it could be confusing the first time but once you've got your answer, I imagine it can be quite easy to understand &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;.</body>

But my point has been and is that if you have room in the scenario book section about this scenario to put all the monster compositions for different character numbers - you should have room to also spell out attack vs attack and move between special 1 and 2. You should also not use word same in the book and not specify same only as it relates to the summon count/composition... I just think it would be a helpful tip in the FAQ about this scenario. That is all. &lt;br/&gt;Happy Adventuring!</body>

			<body>I recently stumbled upon a thread citing the FAQ as source regarding monster movement down the shortest path, specifically an issue regarding closeness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAQ ruling (italics mine):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster can't get within range to attack with its movement, will it still move closer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolutely, monsters will move down the shortest path to get as close as possible to a hex where they can attack their focus, attempting to get into a position where they can attack with maximum efficiency if possible (e.g. avoiding disadvantage (first priority) or maximizing attacks on other targets (second priority)). &lt;i&gt;The shortest path is measured by the minimum total number of hexes the monster needs to physically move&lt;/i&gt; to reach the desired hex.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here the shortest path is measured by minimum total number of hexes, shouldn't it be measured by minimum total number of movement points?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thread where the issue came up: &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28640323&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28640323&lt;/a&gt;</body>

			<body>I think it would be worth adding some clarification of the card 263 under Moon/Eclipse class symbol. Even after carefully reading rulebook and FAQ it is still unclear for me.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]Is there a possibility to use Empowering Void to double various modifiers added to the attack?&lt;br/&gt;E.g. if I combine &quot;Attack 3&quot; action with bottom part of Empowering Void, target poisoned monster, gain +1 Attack from an item and another +1 Attack from my ally's ability card, what will be the result?&lt;br/&gt;(3 + 1 + 1 +1) x 2 = 12? Or only 9?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The example with the Scoundrel in rulebook p20 made me believe in Attack 12 result. But it isn't clear enough.[/o]</body>

			<body>Hi Alex,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I noticed that there are no FAQ entries for Personal Quest #530, but it might be worth pointing out that [o]the card only says &quot;Purchase four enhancements,&quot; not &quot;Enhance four cards&quot; or &quot;Enhance four actions,&quot; i.e. you don't have to hit Prosperity 4 before you can complete this quest.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For what it's worth, I found a deeper discussion of this card (1st ed version) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1757385/life-goal-530-question-spoilers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, wherein people reached the same conclusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDIT: If this is the wrong place to post this, I apologize, and I can post it to the personal quest guide thread instead.</body>

			<body>Right. Because that's the first place people would naturally check after first checking the FAQ that addresses the specific card in question. Jeez. Just thought that might improve the FAQ entry for some people. Also, most people would not intuit that it's an area of effect action given that there's no big red blob on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just sayin.</body>

			<body>There’s a question about a Cragheart card (level 2) that doesn’t seem to have a clear resolution as of yet:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1968531/unique-heal-targeting-situationquestion-cragheart&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1968531/unique-heal-targeti...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]For Sentient Growth’s top action, can you choose an area with only allies, not doing an Attack (since there are no enemies there) but using the Heal on that area? Or does the target area have to be valid for the Attack specifically (thus requiring an enemy there) since the Attack is first and the Heal says it uses the same area?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In other words, is it “choose an area, Attack all enemies in it, Heal all allies in it”, or is it “Attack an area, and also Heal all allies in it”?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As far as I know, the Heal here is the only beneficial action that uses the area-effect rules, which means there’s not a whole lot to extrapolate from.[/o]</body>

			<body>&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;When exactly can I use an item? Can I use it in the middle of a movement or other ability? Can I use items outside of my turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items are only used during your turn unless it is used as a reaction to an enemy (as per its wording) or during a granted out-of-turn action if the action matches the item's restrictions. During your turn you can use an item at any time, including during a movement or after you have taken all your actions, with the following exceptions:&lt;br/&gt;  - Must meet all restrictions listed on the card&lt;br/&gt;  - If an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage or disadvantage), it has to be used before an attack modifier is drawn&lt;br/&gt;  - If an item grants an action, it cannot be used in the middle of another action&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seen there are several questions about using items at the start/end of your turn I believe we need a better understanding of what &lt;i&gt;during your turn&lt;/i&gt; means, specifically if it includes or not the beginning and end of turn actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Referring to threads: &lt;a href=&quot;/article/28760189&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;During turn vs end of turn&lt;/a&gt; (3 spears spoilers) and &lt;a href=&quot;/article/28758847&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Healing potion at start of turn&lt;/a&gt;</body>

			<body>My group has a few questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Minor Mana Potion, Wand of Ice:&lt;br/&gt;Is the element available for immediate use, or is it only activated at the end of the character's turn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Quest 520: If someone else loots that item, are you just out of luck until they retire or you can convince them to sell it?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Monster Summons:&lt;br/&gt;Do Summoned monsters use a normal standee for a monster, or one of the summon tokens?&lt;br/&gt;Do Summoned monsters act immediately before their summoner with a Move +0/Attack +0, or do they get their own initiative card from the appropriate monster deck?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*The Adventure Booklet&lt;br/&gt;In general, how much can I 'read ahead?'  When doing a scenario, can I look at what is behind doors before opening them, or look at all the information about the scenario before selecting my powers?&lt;br/&gt;Can I look at the resolution of a scenario before I attempt it to determine which scenario to do next?  What about during a scenario if it has multiple outcomes (like the Volcano side-scenario?)&lt;br/&gt;I find that during set up I often see this information, and I am not sure to what extent I should discuss it with the other players in advance, or wait until it comes up in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*Enhancement&lt;br/&gt;What is doubled in cost for multi-target enhancements?  Do extra hexes, level modifiers, or previous enhancements counted?&lt;br/&gt;Do X cards count as 1st level cards?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks!</body>

Is it possible to perform each effect in the order we want (seems to be very obvious) ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the token is mooved to another enemy as first effect, can we still perform the other effect or does the enemy is considered no longer doomed ?</body>

			<body>Can I request a couple of rewordings regarding long rests and initiative?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;When I do a long rest, when do the effects (healing, getting your discards back, refreshing spent items) take place?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your full rest happens on initiative 99, so you have to wait until the end of the round to gain the effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If I long rest, do my summons still get a turn during the round?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, they will act directly before initiative 99 as normal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first one disregards effects such as item 15 which (I believe) make it possible to go after a long rest. I guess it's fine if this one remains as is, because the exception might be considered a spoiler, but maybe someone can find a wording that doesn't contain &quot;the end of the round&quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second one is more misleading, because it implies that the summon goes before all other characters with initiative 99 (which would also have implications for tied initiatives on other values). The summon &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; goes at initiative 99 but directly before its summoner. If there are other characters with initiative 99, they might go before the summon.</body>

			<body>I have a question about the range of cards that consume an element and then change what it is that completes.  For instance [o]Spirit of doom. It normally is a curse at range 4 but consume moon and it reads “kill one normal target instead,1”.[/o]  Does this mean that at a range of 4 kill one or does this mean kill 1 normal monster anywhere?  Is this restricted to one room or the entire map?  This also applies to other cards like spirit of the night etc.</body>

I guess it's fine if this one remains as is, because the exception might be considered a spoiler, but maybe someone can find a wording that doesn't contain &quot;the end of the round&quot;?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The second one is more misleading, because it implies that the summon goes before all other characters with initiative 99 (which would also have implications for tied initiatives on other values). The summon &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; goes at initiative 99 but directly before its summoner. If there are other characters with initiative 99, they might go before the summon.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm getting buy-off on the wording for the second one. I've updated the FAQ for the first.</body>

			<body>@Iceman_B, this is already in the FAQ, but it's in the very first section on skipping abilities:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;You may not skip the following abilities/effects:&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;br/&gt;  * Stand alone infusions (i.e. not attached to a specific ability). Note that infusions gained from modifier cards are considered attached to the attack so they can be skipped. &lt;b&gt;Also, at least one ability on the action must be performed in order to gain the a standalone Infusion&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's also explicitly stated in the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;If any of these symbols is visible by itself in an action’s description, it means that by performing any part of the action, the figure must infuse the battlefield with that element.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That said, it might be good to mention it in the FAQ section on Elements as well if that's where people are looking for it.</body>

Unless he is still out there somewhere I never get to fight the Prime Demon. &lt;br/&gt;[/o]I was hoping there would be help in this FAQ.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]It may be disappointing in terms of gameplay, but I don't know what you expected by closing the rift if not sealing it off from your own world.[/o]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]I didn't know I was closing a rift when I started the scenario. The end of 19 Hail just wants to see the Rift. I didn't know closing the Rift would mean defeating the Prime Demon for all time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And I really didn't know I was shutting down 6 other scenarios.[/o]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There were clues in the scenario text in the scenarios leading up to #27.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Scenario #5:&lt;br/&gt;[o]Once you killed the cultists and their minion in the Ruinous Crypt, you are left standing in front of the rift, and are presented a choice:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;You must admit that you wonder whether you could enter the rift yourself and whether you could survive the trip to wherever that rock ended up. [scenario 10]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alternately, finding some way to &lt;b&gt;close the rift&lt;/b&gt; is probably the more prudent decision. [scenarios 14 and 19]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, if you choose to go to #19, the intro text reminds you of what you're aiming to do:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;“You want to do what now?” Hail stares at you blankly. “You’ve found a rift into the Plane of Elemental Power and &lt;b&gt;you want to close it?&lt;/b&gt;”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And completing the scenario leads you to #27.  And again the intro text to that one reminds you of what you are doing there:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;“&lt;b&gt;I’m pretty sure I can close it&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So claiming &quot;I didn't know I was closing the rift&quot; means that you weren't paying attention, and thus the consequences are on you.[/o]</body>

Other people have asked the same question with no answer yet.

			<body>I'm little confused about the &quot;you can not skip xp granting abilities&quot; part.&lt;br/&gt;For example, I'm going to use the mindthief's frigid apparition ability, it says I can consume the ice element to stun an enemy and gain 1 xp. So, if the ice element is strong, do I must consume the ice element to gain the xp? Or I can skip it to leave the element for my allies?</body>

			<body>You can skip the ice. But IF using the element induces STUN &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; the XP, you have to take both.</body>

			<body>There’s a thread regarding monster summons that could potentially use some clarification. A summary of the main questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- If a monster type that was not present on the map at the start of the round is summoned, is an action card drawn for it even though it will not act this round?&lt;br/&gt;- If not, and a player summon acts after the monsters are summoned, how is the summoned monsters’ initiative determined for the purposes of focus rules?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28895351#28895351&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28895351#28895351&lt;/a&gt;</body>

They maximize their attacks just for the current turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;See this &lt;a href=&quot;/geeklist/234575/gloomhaven-rules-quiz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Geek List&lt;/a&gt; for various community created examples of monster movement.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm wondering about the wording of this, specially regarding secondary targets. The rules quiz linked says monsters will choose a secondary focus first and then move, in questions 18 and 19 this involves moving more to perform an attack on the same number of targets both including the primary target.&lt;br/&gt;Would be nice to either support both of those questions directly on the faq (if they are correct) or go a little more in depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've seen the FAQ go through a few rewordings of these rules, some supporting the geek list and others going against it. IMO current wording does neither, to me it's not clear what point 3 refers to. Is it looking at locations and checking all targets at once or is it looking for a secondary focus? Because if its looking at locations as a whole points 4 and 5 are more like 3a and 3b.</body>

IMO current wording does neither, to me it's not clear what point 3 refers to. Is it looking at locations and checking all targets at once or is it looking for a secondary focus? Because if its looking at locations as a whole points 4 and 5 are more like 3a and 3b.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There was a whole thread with rulings from Isaac that resulted in the the list and the wording. The quiz list is community driven (as stated in the FAQ) - I've linked it because it was suggested since some people find it useful. The quiz needs to match the FAQ, not the other way around. If there is ambiguity in the wording on the FAQ, then that needs to be corrected. It would be best to bring up conflicts in that quiz thread to see if they resolve out or if a ruling or wording change is needed.</body>

			<body>This might sound pedantic, but I have a question about enhancements.  &lt;br/&gt;&quot;Double base cost for any ability with multiple targets.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;Target is used throughout the rule book to describe attacking enemies.&lt;br/&gt;You and I might describe a card as &quot;targeting an ally with a heal ability,&quot; but the rules never specifically call this &lt;b&gt;targeting&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;If I have an ability that affects multiple ally figures (Fake Ability: &quot;Heal 1, all allies&quot;), and I enhance it to +1 Heal, is the base cost doubled, despite it not using the terminology &lt;b&gt;Target&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;br/&gt;The only card I know to &quot;Target&quot; an ally is &lt;br/&gt;[o]Cragheart's Nature's Lift with it's target 2[/o]&lt;br/&gt;Granted, I haven't read every single card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would also like to refer to page 21 of the rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Rulebook wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For any attack that targets multiple enemies, an attack modifier card is drawn for each target. It is not possible&lt;br/&gt;to target the same enemy with multiple attacks from the same ability. &lt;b&gt;Note: Abilities can never target allies&lt;br/&gt;(positive abilities meant for allies will use the term “affect” instead of “target”).&lt;/b&gt; An ally can be within the&lt;br/&gt;affected area of an attack, but they will not be targeted by it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This leads me to believe that enhancing something like [o]the bottom of Tinkerer's Flamethrower (shield 1 adjacent allies)[/o] would not have double base cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: My apologies for not reading the first post and creating a separate thread for my question.</body>

But, if you look at the explanations of bless/strengthen enhancements, the last line states &quot;The specified condition is applied to all targets of the ability.&quot; I'm guessing that the positive conditions/effects &lt;i&gt;affect&lt;/i&gt; friendly targets, and that it's a case of unclear wording (again).</body>

It seems that it's unclear what exactly this means. The two main interpretations seem to be:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. You completely disregard the fact that you're attacking multiple targets and have already selected the primary target and rank all enemies by focus rules (as if you were doing a single-target attack). Then you choose the set of targets which a) includes the monster's actual focus, b) contains the maximum number of targets, c) contains the highest-ranked targets in single-target focus order (so if you can target the second-highest ranked target with any sets, discard all sets which don't include it, then the third-highest etc.). This is the interpretation used by the quiz right now.&lt;br/&gt;2. While &quot;using focus rules&quot; you do take into account that you're doing a multi-target attack which includes the focus. In this case, you first look at the shortest path to reach each target set, then at the proximity to the monsters in each set and then at the initiatives in each set (although even then it's unclear what happens in the case of two sets of three monsters where the first comparison gives identical proximities; do you first compare proximities of the next pair of monsters or do you first compare initiatives of the tied monsters). This is the interpretation used by Alejandro which results in shorter movement for quiz questions 18 and 19.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I do think the problem is that the current wording is unclear (because we don't know how you actually &quot;use focus rules&quot; when dealing with sets of targets), but if you prefer we can still discuss this in one of the other threads (or create yet another one).</body>

			<body>Recently came across a question with a Two Mini card. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]Card in question is Maul: Move 3/Shield 1, Affect 1 adjacent ally. This thread seems to provide an answer: &lt;a href=&quot;/article/28995399&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Two Mini Question&lt;/a&gt;. I've seen the other classes have the adjacent shields explained on the FAQ, IMO this one should be added as well, if possible with an official confirmation on how it works.[/o]</body>

But which party was affected would depend on when you choose to do the city event ... after a scenario upon return to Gloomhaven ... or before a scenario, as a party sets out from Gloomhaven. Either option is okay, but only one City event can be done per visit to Gloomhaven, so only the active party when the city event is drawn would be affected.</body>

			<body>Could I request another addition? Basically the answers to &lt;a href=&quot;/thread/1995746/can-individual-targets-be-skipped&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;the questions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You said &lt;a href=&quot;/article/25190353#25190353&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;back here&lt;/a&gt; that AoE targets can't be skipped but Target X targets can be skipped. If that's correct (and presumably it is, since Isaac didn't contradict you on this in that thread), it would be good to have this either in the &quot;skippable effects&quot; entry or elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's also not entirely clear whether Target X abilities can be performed by skipping &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; targets (like doing a Move X as a Move 0). General consensus seems to be it can't, but I'm not seeing any unambiguous justification for this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And lastly (independently of the above thread, but related to this), could the entry on Add Target in the context of AoE be amended to state explicitly whether or not the added target is then considered part of the targeted area?

			<body>Hey, can you clarify on the following from the FAQ-&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which event rewards/penalties affect a single character and which affect all characters?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;The result affects each character separately if the word &quot;each&quot; is included&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does this mean if the City/Road event specifies &lt;i&gt;Lose X Gold each and gain Y&lt;/i&gt; (where Y is not an item, e.g. Bless) then the gain is also applied individually?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So any party members that do not have X gold will not get Y, but those that do will?</body>

			<body>Edit: Just checked the card that confused us, it's actually worded slightly differently...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;City Event X wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All characters XXXXX&lt;br/&gt;Lose X Gold Each&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I guess that clears that up, everyone gets the benefit and lose up 3 to gold, whatever they can afford.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry for confusion.</body>

			<body>Following &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2000408/movement-rule-multiple-targets&quot;   &gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt;, could I request a minor improvement of the wording about maximising attacks when the focus can't be reached this turn? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This part:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster can't get within range to attack with its movement, will it still move closer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Absolutely, monsters will move down the shortest path to get as close as possible to a hex where they can attack their focus, attempting to get into a position where they can attack with maximum efficiency if possible (e.g. avoiding disadvantage (first priority) or maximizing attacks on other targets (second priority)).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think this could be reasonably interpreted as moving toward the hex that maximises the attack, whereas I think you mean that you only maximise the attack among hexes which are the same (closest) distance away. It would help to split up the sentence to clarify this, e.g.:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Absolutely, monsters will move down the shortest path to get as close as possible to a hex where they can attack their focus. If there are multiple hexes tied for closeness, they will move toward a position where they can attack with maximum efficiency if possible (e.g. avoiding disadvantage (first priority) or maximizing attacks on other targets (second priority)).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's also the entry with the movement priorities, which I found a bit misleading. That entire entry seems to assume that the attack can actually be performed this turn. Otherwise:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Having &quot;attack as many extra targets as possible&quot; with higher priority than &quot;move as little as possible to attack the chosen targets&quot;, would mean that the monster would take a detour towards a multi-target hex if it can't reach the focus this turn.&lt;br/&gt;- And the final paragraph – &quot;Note that monsters do not take future turns into account when maximizing their attacks. They maximize their attacks just for the current turn.&quot; – would contradict the above FAQ entry, because that one clearly doesn't completely ignore maximisation of future attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would probably help if this entire FAQ entry explicitly qualified that all of this only matters if the focus itself can be attacked on the current turn (right in the beginning).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main reason that I was confused by all of this is that the rule book is rather unclear here. It simply contains the two blanket statements &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Page 30 wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;If a monster has an attack ability after its movement, it will move the least number of hexes possible in such a way as to attack its focused enemy with maximum effect.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Page 30 wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt; If it is a multi-target attack, it will move toward a position where its attack will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;neither of which states that this only happens if the attack actually takes place on the current turn. That is sort of tucked away in the last sentence of the paragraph on ranged attacks.</body>

They maximize their attacks just for the current turn.&quot; – would contradict the above FAQ entry, because that one clearly doesn't completely ignore maximisation of future attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would probably help if this entire FAQ entry explicitly qualified that all of this only matters if the focus itself can be attacked on the current turn (right in the beginning).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main reason that I was confused by all of this is that the rule book is rather unclear here. It simply contains the two blanket statements &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#0B5C0D&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Page 30 wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;If a monster has an attack ability after its movement, it will move the least number of hexes possible in such a way as to attack its focused enemy with maximum effect.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#0B5C0D&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Page 30 wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt; If it is a multi-target attack, it will move toward a position where its attack will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;neither of which states that this only happens if the attack actually takes place on the current turn. That is sort of tucked away in the last sentence of the paragraph on ranged attacks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Your wording on the first entry is incorrect as it is against the rules. Also, the second entry in the FAQ already has a note stating explicitly that maximizing attacks is about the current turn. &lt;strike&gt;I'm going to reply to the thread you referenced to clarify.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was going to reply in that other thread but it should be discussed here since that entry may need some rewording. Let me think on it after I get home tonight and post back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: I have new wording pending review by Isaac. Will update when I get approval.</body>

			<body>FAQ Update&lt;br/&gt;------------&lt;br/&gt;Combined and clarified two of the Monster Movement entries to define how the prioritization rules are evaluated if the monster can (or can't) reach the attack hex in the current turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This entry was simplified and now refers to the prioritization entry:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FAQ wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster can't get within range to attack with its movement, will it still move closer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, see the next question for how it will choose it's destination hex.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And importantly the prioritization entry was reworded (both the question and answer).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic issue with the current wording is that if there is a space within your movement where you can attack the primary target, and there is a space outside your movement range where you can ideally attack multiple targets, you will move towards that because there is no distinction between the current movement range and infinite movement range in the rules. Instead, there should be two evaluations - first you evaluate the ideal space to attack from within your current movement range, and if there is no space to attack from, you then evaluate the ideal space to attack from given infinite movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also clarified the wording about the monster not taking into account future turns during the evaluation - It should be about using the monster's current attack during the evaluation vs whatever attack it will have in a future turn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; </body>

			<subject>Re: Official FAQ for Game Revs 1 and 2 (no rules questions please)</subject>
			<body>Sorry to bring this up again, but I feel like the matter of AI Quiz questions #18 and #19 (or rather the corresponding rules) still hasn't been cleared up completely. The last time I brought this up, you added the last bit of this sentence:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;3rd - If there are multiple attack locations with an equal number of different extra targets, use the focus rules (from its starting position) to determine priority on these extra targets to select which of the previously determined locations it should move to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issue is that there still seems to be some debate about the exact meaning of &quot;use the focus rules (from its starting position)&quot;. The two interpretations are essentially:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Ignoring the fact that we're doing a multi-target attack, rank all enemies by focus rules, and then attack the set of monsters which includes the second-highest ranked enemy (because you're attacking the focus anyway). If that's still ambiguous, attack the set that also includes the third-highest ranked enemy etc. This interpretation leads to the answers which the Quiz claims are correct.&lt;br/&gt;or&lt;br/&gt;- While ranking enemies, do take into account that you're performing a multi-target attack and that you have need to include the focus in the attack. This changes the positions from which you can actually attack each possible target and in particular changes the path lengths to each target (and therefore the focus order). I &lt;i&gt;think&lt;/i&gt; this is what you're edit was trying to say by saying that the focus rules are used to choose &quot;which of the previously determined locations it should move to&quot;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/article/28958919#28958919&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;what Isaac meant by&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Now that you have found multiple valid locations from which to attack, figure out how to best attack secondary, tertiary, etc. targets using the same focusing rules.&quot; This would change the correct Quiz answers to &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, respectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But I think the underlying problem is that there's no one obvious way to generalise &quot;use the focus rules&quot; to rank multi-target attacks. In particular it's not clear whether you apply the focus rules to whole sets of targets or to individual targets and then pick the set containing the secondary, tertiary etc target (according to Isaac's comment it seems to be the latter). So my request is twofold:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, it would be great if one of the two of you could leave a comment on those two quiz questions to officially clarify whether or not they are correct as they currently are. Especially since the Quiz is linked to from this very FAQ entry, it would be good to make sure that it's not actually misleading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, expand the shorthand of &quot;using the same focus rules&quot; into an actual explanation of how that is done when ranking sets of multiple targets. If my understanding is correct, then it should actually be simple enough to describe it explicitly in a couple of steps (although I'm sure you can come up with something better, and maybe also more concise without sacrificing clarity):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Pick the set of targets which you can attack with the least amount of movement.&lt;br/&gt;2. If multiple sets can be reached with the same amount of movement, you need to find a secondary priority target:&lt;br/&gt;2.1. Among the targets in the tied sets, the secondary priority target is the one closest to the monster (measured by proximity).&lt;br/&gt;2.2. If that is still tied, it's the target that is earliest in initiative order.&lt;br/&gt;3. Pick the target set which contains the secondary target.&lt;br/&gt;4. If there are still multiple sets which contain the secondary target, ties between them are resolved by following the same steps starting at 2 to find a tertiary priority target and so on.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, step 2 is using the same tie breakers as focus rules, but first step now needs to take into account that we're already set on one (or more) other targets and can only move in such a way that we still attack those (and don't gain disadvantage on the focus itself).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Again, all of this is assuming that I interpreted Isaac's response and your edit correctly.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry for the wall of text, and I know it's a tremendous edge case, but for fan-made tools like Gloomhaven AI and people who just enjoy the puzzle of foiling the enemy AI, it would be great to have the actual AI algorithm down unambiguously.</body>

			<subject>Re: Official FAQ for Game Revs 1 and 2 (no rules questions please)</subject>
			<body>To the best of my understanding, the algorithm that a monster with &quot;ATTACK N&quot; follows is:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Choose a primary focus as if it were attacking a single target (ST).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Can it reach any hex with its current movement to attack its focus and at least one additional target this turn, or to attack its focus at all? If not, follow movement rules for making a ST attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Can it reach any hex with its current movement to attack its focus and the maximum number of additional targets this turn, without gaining disadvantage on its primary focus or setting off traps? If yes, move to that hex, if there is only one such spot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. If there are multiple valid hexes for (3), choose a secondary focus. The secondary focus must be within attack range of at least one of these hexes. From all targets that meet this criteria, choose a secondary focus as if the monster were performing a ST attack against it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Repeat (3), except any valid hexes must allow the monster to attack both its primary and secondary focuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Repeat (4) if there are still multiple valid hexes, adding focuses until the maximum number of additional targets have been focused. If there are still multiple hexes that are in range of all targets and don't cause disadvantage, choose the hex that requires the least amount of movement. If multiple hexes tie for least movement, players decide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;7. If there is no hex that lets the monster attack its maximum number of targets without gaining disadvantage on its primary focus or setting off traps, follow steps (3)-(6) as if the monster has &quot;ATTACK N-1&quot;. If there is still no valid hex, continue removing targets until a hex is chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;8. If the monster must attack its primary focus with disadvantage this turn, it does so. In that case, follow steps (3)-(7) to select which hex to move to, ignoring the disadvantage requirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;9. If the only possible paths a monster can take to eventually attack any target, if it had infinite movement, would set off a trap, follow steps (3)-(8) above, setting off as few traps as possible.</body>

Can it reach any hex with its current movement to attack its focus and at least one additional target this turn, or to attack its focus at all? If not, follow movement rules for making a ST attack.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not quite, if the monster can't reach its focus at all, it will use the multi-target rules with infinite movement and then move towards the resulting hex. That part of the FAQ was just clarified earlier this week.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;4. [...] From all targets that meet this criteria, choose a secondary focus &lt;b&gt;as if the monster were performing a ST attack against it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is where I (and some others) disagree and why I think the FAQ should be clarified. The way I interpret the comment by Isaac which I linked, we shouldn't treat them as single targets, because we're not doing ST attacks. We need to rank the targets in the context of a multi-target attack that necessarily includes the focus and previously selected additional targets.</body>

If it can't reach the destination hex this turn, it will move to get as close as possible to that hex.

			<body>I very much like the recent improvements to the &lt;b&gt;Monster - Movement&lt;/b&gt; section of the FAQ.  It's much clearer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One point of clarification about the answer to the question &quot;&lt;b&gt;After determining focus, how exactly does a monster chose its destination hex and how does it maximize its attack on its focus and any additional targets?&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prioritization rules listed in the answer do not mention the distance of the destination hex from the monster's current position.  My understanding is, given all the other priorities being equal, the monster will choose the closest destination hex.  In effect, it would be a 5th priority:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5th - Move the shortest distance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most relevant with ranged attacks, obviously.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps that is just assumed or implied.  Or maybe its already in the FAQ and I just missed it.  Or perhaps I'm wrong about how monsters move.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;aflorin wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;After determining focus, how exactly does a monster chose its destination hex and how does it maximize its attack on its focus and any additional targets?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will determine its final destination hex (the hex where it can attack it's focus) by using the prioritization rules below &lt;u&gt;before moving&lt;/u&gt;. The evaluation is first done using the monster's current movement range. If the monster can't reach a hex from which to attack using the movement it has this turn, the rules are re-evaluated assuming infinite movement. Also, the monster uses its current attack when determining its attack/movement options, even if it may have a different (or no) attack when it eventually reaches its destination hex. If there are multiple hexes that meet the criteria, players decide ties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;1st - Attack its primary focus, losing/avoiding disadvantage if possible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;2nd - Attack as many extra targets as possible&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;3rd - If there are multiple attack locations with an equal number of different extra targets, use the focus rules (from its starting position) to determine priority on these extra targets to select which of the previously determined locations it should move to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;   &lt;/pre&gt;4rd - Lose disadvantage on the extra targets (all equal priority, players decide ties)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</body>

			<body>From FAQ section&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Experience&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can I play a card just for the experience?&lt;br/&gt;You have to perform at least one part of the action on the card to gain the experience. If it just says &quot;Attack,&quot; you have to attack an enemy to get the experience. If it has &quot;Attack&quot; and &quot;Move,&quot; however, you can just move and not attack and still get the experience. A larger experience symbol (as opposed to a small one) is not meant to be tied to any specific ability in the action.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does this mean an attack has to be tied to any part of the attack? not just a specific line item?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My real question is; can we swing at air and just claim experience?</body>

			<body>FAQ Update&lt;br/&gt;------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updated the Monster Movement - 'choosing the destination hex' entry to clarify how the focus rules are used to resolve ties of extra targets. Also included the &quot;Use least movement&quot; priority at the appropriate position.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added Lightning class card 343 entry to clarify how to deal with self or ally immunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh, and I confirmed from Isaac the answer to the two quiz questions that spawned the edge case ruling.

			<body>Thanks Alex, an official word on the quiz questions helps a lot, &lt;strike&gt;but I think the part that you've clarified in the FAQ was not the one that caused the confusion. The reason that people argue that the quiz was correct is that they interpret &quot;using the focus rules (from the starting position)&quot; as something equivalent to &quot;the secondary target is that target which would have been the focus if the actual focus was an obstacle instead&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was hoping the new wording could explicitly include the fact that for additional targets, when determining the path length for getting into range, you need to take into account that you still have to attack all previously selected targets. (Judging by Isaac's comment the last time I asked about this, I imagine that you didn't include it because he or both of you think this is obvious, but this entire discussion never would have come up if it was.)&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDIT: Ooooh wait, nevermind. I completely missed the fact that the inclusion of &quot;use the least amount of movement&quot; as a separate step already resolves the issue. I feel like this raises another question though: if there are two possible attack hexes, the same distance away, and we need to use the focus rules to break the tie between further targets, is &quot;movement distance from the starting position as if it were the only target&quot; still a part of that, or do you start immediately at &quot;proximity as the crow flies&quot;? Here is an example for this question:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4184502"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/F-V41ifd76_4Pp4vFoRJtu8qJyQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic4184502.png" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red is the monster, blue are characters (with initiatives), brown is an obstacle. Consider this as a variation of quiz question #18 where the monster has Move 3 and an AoE attack that hits two hexes in a straight line in front of it (like Skewer). The question is whether the monster will attack 2 or 3 (in addition to 1). If &quot;steps to get into range as if it was a single-target attack&quot; is still a part of &quot;using the focus rules&quot;, the secondary target would be 3, because it can be reached with only 2 steps. If we go straight to the proximity and initiative tie breakers, the secondary target would be 2 (because proximity is identical so we go by initiative).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, just in case you overlooked it, could you have another look &lt;a href=&quot;/article/29167043#29167043&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;at this question about a wording on a monster ability card&lt;/a&gt;?</body>

			<body>I just had the thought that perhaps understanding of d/a would improve if the attack process is described differently. Just as a rough example:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;1.) Figure out your base attack value, ie.: printed damage + external modifiers like poison and damage buffs.&lt;br/&gt;2.) Flip over the attack modifier and apply it.&lt;br/&gt; In case of advantage, flip over two and take the one that would have the (mathematically) higher result. Rolling modifiers are always applied in addition to the card.&lt;br/&gt; In case of disadvantage, flip over two and take the one that would have the lower result. Rolling modifiers are never applied.&lt;br/&gt;All additional effects (status, elemental infusion), have the value &quot;Hail&quot;, which is larger than 0.&lt;br/&gt;3.) Subtract shield.&lt;br/&gt;4.) Apply damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Remember: Hail is capricious. You're better off with her than without her, but you can't say how many people she'll be worth.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</body>

			<body>That's not actually correct though. Additional effects don't have a value between 0 and 1, but a value which is greater than 0 but undefined. To use your example, there's no way to tell whether three people and Hail are better than four people or even better than thirteen people. But three people and Hail are better than three people without Hail and worse than four people and Hail.</body>

			<body>I don't know what you mean by &quot;character 3 can be reached in two steps&quot;. The attack hexes against both 3 and 2 are the same walking distance from the monster. The obstacle isn't in the way (or am I missing something?) In this scenario, the monster will attack 1 and 2.

Here is an example for this question:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4184502"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/F-V41ifd76_4Pp4vFoRJtu8qJyQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic4184502.png" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red is the monster, blue are characters (with initiatives), brown is an obstacle. Consider this as a variation of quiz question #18 where the monster has Move 3 and an AoE attack that hits two hexes in a straight line in front of it (like Skewer). The question is whether the monster will attack 2 or 3 (in addition to 1). If &quot;steps to get into range as if it was a single-target attack&quot; is still a part of &quot;using the focus rules&quot;, the secondary target would be 3, because it can be reached with only 2 steps. If we go straight to the proximity and initiative tie breakers, the secondary target would be 2 (because proximity is identical so we go by initiative).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, just in case you overlooked it, could you have another look &lt;a href=&quot;/article/29167043#29167043&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;at this question about a wording on a monster ability card&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</body>

To me, it's three hexes for either one.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's three movement to the hex southwest to do a skewer attack on 1 and 3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's three movement to the hex northwest to do a skewer attack on 1 and 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exactly the same in both cases. The obstacle doesn't change anything because the monster will move two hexes due east and then one hex either to the northeast or southeast, depending on which destination hex is chosen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ah ha! I've worked out what is meant. If the monster moves one hex to the east and then one hex to the northeast, it can attack #3 (since it's assumed to have a two-hexes-in-a-straight-line melee attack. It can't move to the equivalent spot to attack #2 because of the obstacle. This means that if #1 wasn't there, it would be attacking #3 because it takes less movement to reach a hex from which it can attack.</body>

The attack hexes against both 3 and 2 are the same walking distance from the monster. The obstacle isn't in the way (or am I missing something?) In this scenario, the monster will attack 1 and 2. It chooses 2 over 3 because it has a lower initiative.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The others have already explained what I meant, but just to confirm: I still think there's two possible interpretations of &quot;using focus rules&quot; when choosing secondary targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Backtrack for a second to the point where we determine the monster's focus (which completely ignores the fact that we're doing a multi-target or AoE attack). In this step, while we only care about &lt;i&gt;the one&lt;/i&gt; focus, the focus rules actually give us an ordering of all possible targets. In the example above that ordering is 1 &amp;gt; 3 &amp;gt; 2. With a Skewer-like AoE, 3 is prioritised over 2, because we could reach it in two steps (east, northeast), whereas we'd need three steps to attack 2 since the obstacle is in the way. Now the first interpretation of &quot;using focus rules&quot; would be, &quot;the secondary target is the second target in the ordering determined by focus rules at the beginning of the AI algorithm&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The second interpretation is that we skip the &quot;shortest path to attack the target&quot; step of the focus rules, because that's already covered by rejecting any destination hexes that aren't closest. In that case &quot;using focus rules&quot; would refer only to the tie breakers of the focus rules, i.e. proximity (tied in the above example) and initiative (which results in 2 being attacked instead of 3).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I get the impression that 2 is the correct interpretation, but what I'm saying is that I still think that the phrase &quot;using focus rules&quot; is just not a sufficiently clear shorthand due to the different context from when we usually apply those focus rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does this explanation make more sense?</body>

I don't think the fact that it has &quot;range&quot; matters.  The monster will base distance to target using the melee rule of minimum movement to a hex adjacent to the player, not a hex where the player will be within the aoe range.  In this case the distance to get adjacent to 2 and 3 is the same, so initiative is the tiebreaker.</body>

			<body>Yeah, I didn't account for the skewer AoE when determining distance. The main question is do you include the primary focus in the attack when evaluating the focus for the next target or do you assume you are attacking it by itself. I am almost certain you include the main focus in the evaluation but I've pinged Isaac to confirm and will update the wording either way.</body>

Since 1 is there, the choice is between attacking 1+3 or 1+2. 3 had higher priority than 2 originally, but if you recompute based on the hexes the attacks will actually be made from, 1+2 and 1+3 have equal path distance to attack, so the initiative tie-breaker kicks in and the monster attacks 1+2 rather than 1+3 despite 3 having higher priority than 2 originally.</body>

Very curious to hear the answer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMO it is a simpler process to rank secondary targets as though they are being attacked individually. If that's any consideration in the ruling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: Thinking about this a bit more. If secondary targets are not ranked individually, we'll need a procedure for how to pick the third and subsequent targets as well. Presumably, you'd first pick a second target.  Then pick a third target by including the first and second targets in the attack. And you'd pick a fourth target by including the first three targets in the attack. Etc.</body>

That's why I posted an additional example on the previous page, which actually depends on how ranking of secondary targets works.</body>

			<body>I posted this on a thread a few days ago but since it pertains to entries of the FAQ some clarification would be nice, specially if there is a general ruling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thread: &lt;a href=&quot;/thread/2015282/control-actions-clarification-circles-spoilers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Control actions and ranged allies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thing is some classes like Mind Thief have an entry stating range does not apply to granted Attack X actions (see lvl 8 Domination).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spoilers for other classes:&lt;br/&gt;[o]Sun has an entry for Empowering Command but not for level 6 Illuminate the Target.&lt;br/&gt;Music Note has no entry for Call to Action, Inspiring Anthem or Booming Proclamation[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is not clear if the ruling also applies to abilities that grant Attack +X which would nerf [o] Circles pretty heavily, since a lot of its summons are ranged.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I am assuming granted Attack X actions default to melee while Attack +X can use the ally's base range if any. Official clarification would be nice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From the FAQ this is the only entry on the summon section:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a summon has a &quot;-&quot; for its move or attack, can I grant it move or attack actions, respectively?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It depends. The &quot;-&quot; means that it has no base for that stat. So you cant' grant an &quot;Attack +2&quot; action to a summon with a &quot;-&quot;, as that is a modifier to an undefined base, but you can grant it an &quot;Attack 2&quot; action, as that sets the base. The same applies to movement. Also note that summons (or monsters) with &quot;-&quot; movement can still be pushed and pulled.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then there is this bit on +X vs X cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the difference between “Ability +X” vs “Ability X”?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Ability +X” makes an adjustment to an existing ability while “Ability X” grants the figure a new ability.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</body>

			<body>@aflorin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alex, there's a thread in General forum that I believe should be here. It raises a question on timing of non-attack modifiers in an attack deck. The main one being raised is to do with the timing of a Heal modifier, but it could also apply to others&lt;br/&gt;[o]Such as the item refresh perk available for some classes[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial post has been addressed (it was for a Lightning class ability), but questions remain regarding a related Mindthief augment and attack deck heals. In summary, do those heals take place as part of the attack action or afterwards. Or, from a different perspective, do those heals come in before or after any Retaliate that may be applicable?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/29430535#29430535&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/29430535#29430535&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully, we can get an official ruling at some point.</body>

			<body>Thanks for the updates, Alex! Not sure whether you've already seen them in their own threads, but I have a couple more requests for the backlog:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2017465/travelling-casual-mode&quot;   &gt;Does casual mode update the party's location?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1789955/random-dungeon-penalty-question&quot;   &gt;What's the duration of random dungeon penalties?&lt;/a&gt;</body>

Basically the answers to &lt;a href=&quot;/thread/1995746/can-individual-targets-be-skipped&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;the questions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You said &lt;a href=&quot;/article/25190353#25190353&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;back here&lt;/a&gt; that AoE targets can't be skipped but Target X targets can be skipped. If that's correct (and presumably it is, since Isaac didn't contradict you on this in that thread), it would be good to have this either in the &quot;skippable effects&quot; entry or elsewhere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's also not entirely clear whether Target X abilities can be performed by skipping &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; targets (like doing a Move X as a Move 0). General consensus seems to be it can't, but I'm not seeing any unambiguous justification for this.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[...]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</body>

			<subject>Re: Official FAQ for Game Revs 1 and 2 (no rules questions please)</subject>
			<body>Reading over the FAQ after those changes I noticed these confusing parts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An attack effect is the effect that occurs after the attack. It occurs even if the attack does no damage, including due to the NULL or Curse cards. You must chose whether you will do an effect attached to an attack before you draw a modifier card.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is confusing on its own because sometimes modifiers add attack effects. The implication, which I think is unintended, is that you can't choose whether or not to apply attack effects added by modifier cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, if you compare that text to the following, there is an additional issue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;When does a non-attack-effect ability (like Heal) that is attached to an attack go off?&lt;br/&gt;It goes off after the attack finishes, so after retaliate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both of these occur after the attack, and apparently so does retaliate. Saying that alone does not properly convey that they happen in a specific order (attack effects, retaliate, then non-attack-effects). (In other words, the &quot;so after retaliate&quot; is not a fair conclusion to come to based on the previous statement.) I suggest saying that attack effects follow attack damage, retaliate follows attack effects, and heal follows the whole attack including retaliate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There may also be some lack of clarity about what exactly constitutes an attack effect and a non-attack-effect. The two quotes contradict each other on that. (The first one says &quot;An attack effect is the effect that occurs after the attack.&quot;, which is a pretty broad definition.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do the heal rolling modifier cards work?&lt;br/&gt;Any time a &quot;Heal&quot; attack modifier card is resolved, the figure who flipped it heals the amount specified. This heal can remove wound and poison like any other heal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This answer should be updated in light of the change.</body>

It occurs even if the attack does no damage, including due to the NULL or Curse cards. You must chose whether you will do an effect attached to an attack before you draw a modifier card.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is confusing on its own because sometimes modifiers add attack effects. The implication, which I think is unintended, is that you can't choose whether or not to apply attack effects added by modifier cards.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would argue that there isn't such an implication.  Or that the implication should be that by designing your deck that way you've already committed to choosing to do them when they come out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think you must have misread something. I said I thought the implication of those sentences was that you &lt;b&gt;didn't&lt;/b&gt; get to choose for them. If you think there isn't such an implication, that would mean you think you do get to choose, which contradicts your next sentence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm saying you already made the choice when you chose your perks.  That satisfies the 'before you draw' by definition.  I think the implication is that you cannot choose not to apply them after the attack &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; you already made that choice.  While it could be explicit I don't think it's confusing.</body>

			<body>Alex, could I run one more multi-target monster AI example by you? Let me apologise in advance for the wall of text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4203790"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/rUYANIhw_222e1iRdtuHoa8XVBQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic4203790.png" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Green is an obstacle. The monster has at least Move 3 and the AoE on the right. The character numbers correspond to their initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is going to be a bit of a tricky edge case, so I hope I can explain this clearly. Let's go through the steps:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;1st - Attack its primary focus, losing/avoiding disadvantage if possible&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus is obviously character 1. Disadvantage is not a concern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;2nd - Attack as many extra targets as possible&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We can attack the maximum of 3 targets by moving to one of the hexes south of 1 and attacking either 1, 2, 5 or 1, 3, 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;3rd - Use the least amount of movement points around walls, obstacles and hazards (if possible) using the normal, jumping and flying movement rules&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both destination hexes are 3 points of movement away, so this doesn't change anything.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;4th - If there are still multiple attack locations with an equal number of different extra targets, use the focus rules (from its starting position) to determine which secondary target (in addition to the previous target(s)) should be included in the attack (repeating for a tertiary target, etc.) and select the attack location which includes these targets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alright, now the interesting part. To select which set of targets actually gets attacked, we need to determine the secondary target among 2, 3, 4 and 5. The relevant part of the FAQ is &quot;in addition to the previous target(s)&quot;. The way I understand this is that (for the first additional target) we check how many points of movement we need to attack both the focus and that secondary target. In this case it's only two points to attack 3 (in addition to 1), but three points to attack 2 (in addition to 1), because the obstacle is in the way. So this would mean that the monster attacks 1, 3 and 4.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;However...&lt;/b&gt; this seems to go against what Isaac told me a while ago (back when this fourth step still the third step):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;The third step of that particular FAQ does not stand on its own. It is the third step in a series of steps. Now that you have found multiple valid locations from which to attack, figure out how to best attack secondary, tertiary, etc. targets using the same focusing rules. The third step doesn't say, &quot;Okay, ignore all previous steps and do this instead.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interpreting the FAQ like I did above similarly disregards the fact that the monster already decided to attack 3 targets. Instead, it uses a hypothetical attack against only two targets (the focus and the candidate secondary target) to pick its secondary target. This seems to go against Isaac's intent here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That makes me wonder whether the intended interpretation is instead that you only look at possible attacks which a) include all previously selected targets (in this case only the focus) and b) still attack as many targets as possible. In that case, you'd need 3 points of movement for both 2 and 3, in which case you'd move on to the focus tie breakers: they're both the same as-the-crow-flies distance from the monster, and then 2 has the lower initiative, so the monster would end up attacking 1, 2 and 5 instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So... one last thing: if this second interpretation (resulting in an attack on 1, 2 and 5) is in fact correct, this would simplify the AI rules greatly. At first glance, this seems more complicated than just taking into account previous targets, but it turns out that in this case we can actually skip the movement-points step of the focusing rules altogether for secondary targets. This is because all possible targets will always be tied on this movement-distance, because we've already narrowed down the destination hexes to those that can be reached with the least amount of movement. Hence, secondary targets would be ranked &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; by as-the-crow-flies proximity and initiative, which is much simpler and avoids all of that &quot;taking into account the context of this attack&quot; business, because those two metrics can be evaluated trivially for each target on its own. I also believe that this interpretation is consistent with the wording in the rule book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In that case, the steps would be:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   1st - Attack its primary focus, losing/avoiding disadvantage if possible&lt;br/&gt;   2nd - Attack as many extra targets as possible&lt;br/&gt;   3rd - Use the least amount of movement points around walls, obstacles and hazards (if possible) using the normal, jumping and flying movement rules&lt;br/&gt;   4th - If there are still multiple attack locations with an equal number of different extra targets, determine which secondary target (in addition to the previous target(s)) should be included in the attack (repeating for a tertiary target, etc.) and select the attack location which includes these targets. Additional targets are ranked by the tie breakers from the focus rules, i.e. first prioritising those closest to the monster and then those with the lowest initiative.&lt;br/&gt;   5th - Lose disadvantage on the extra targets (all equal priority, players decide ties)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wording of step 4 could probably still be simplified, but I think conceptually this is a lot easier than what we have right now. It also avoids referring to &quot;the focus rules&quot; which I still maintain simply are not defined in such a way that it's unambiguously clear how to apply them for secondary targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry again to be belabouring this point so much, but I hope I could make clear what I'm getting at.</body>

You must chose whether you will do an effect attached to an attack before you draw a modifier card.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is confusing on its own because sometimes modifiers add attack effects. The implication, which I think is unintended, is that you can't choose whether or not to apply attack effects added by modifier cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, if you compare that text to the following, there is an additional issue:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#0B5C0D&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;When does a non-attack-effect ability (like Heal) that is attached to an attack go off?&lt;br/&gt;It goes off after the attack finishes, so after retaliate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both of these occur after the attack, and apparently so does retaliate. Saying that alone does not properly convey that they happen in a specific order (attack effects, retaliate, then non-attack-effects). (In other words, the &quot;so after retaliate&quot; is not a fair conclusion to come to based on the previous statement.) I suggest saying that attack effects follow attack damage, retaliate follows attack effects, and heal follows the whole attack including retaliate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There may also be some lack of clarity about what exactly constitutes an attack effect and a non-attack-effect. The two quotes contradict each other on that. (The first one says &quot;An attack effect is the effect that occurs after the attack.&quot;, which is a pretty broad definition.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#0B5C0D&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do the heal rolling modifier cards work?&lt;br/&gt;Any time a &quot;Heal&quot; attack modifier card is resolved, the figure who flipped it heals the amount specified. This heal can remove wound and poison like any other heal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This answer should be updated in light of the change.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let me think on the wording. The intent for the order is 1)Attack 2) Effect 3)Ability. The entry was from a question about Heal specifically but there may be others that it applies to as well (which is why I kept it more general). I believe the distinction between effects and abilities is clear but if anyone is aware of any that are ambiguous, please let me know. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, the entry about choosing the effect prior to the drawing the modifier card is not about effects from the modifier cards themselves. I'll make that clear.</body>

Healing is an Ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit:  I suppose the distinction would be that an Ability is nominally performed by itself. However, there are cases (like the discussed Heal), where an ability is granted as a result of Attack. I think all effects are always (and only) associated with an attack.</body>

			<body>&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;aflorin wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yeah, the term is overused. Healing is an Ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit:  I suppose the distinction would be that an Ability is nominally performed by itself. However, there are cases (like the discussed Heal), where an ability is granted as a result of Attack. I think all effects are always (and only) associated with an attack.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's only a suggestion, but I think this may be a time where an explicit list may be appropriate. Page 22 of the rulebook lists the attack effects followed by the conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, the order would be:&lt;br/&gt;1) Attack (including any Pierce)&lt;br/&gt;2) Attack effects as per page 22 (excluding Pierce)&lt;br/&gt;3) Retaliate from target&lt;br/&gt;4) Everything else (such as conditions, element infusions, healing, etc)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That therefore becomes definitive, with the definition of attack effects being as per the rulebook.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This leaves one attack effect potentially ambiguous: Add Target (especially if the Add Target is used to target a monster with Retaliate). The above would have the Add Target (and subsequent attack) come in before any Retaliate or Healing (assuming Heal attack modifiers), which may not be what's intended. If it's not, I would suggest the following instead:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Attack (including any Pierce)&lt;br/&gt;2) Push and/or Pull effects&lt;br/&gt;3) Retaliate from target&lt;br/&gt;4) Everything else (such as conditions, element infusions, healing, etc) apart from Add Target&lt;br/&gt;5) Add Target attack effect&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I specified Push/Pull explicitly, because after removing Pierce and Add Target, they're the only two attack effects left...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EDIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hmm... this raises the question of what happens if the retaliate kills the attacker? I presume step 4 still applies (with any healing being ineffectual), but what about Add Target?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And I thought this would clear up any confusion... &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/cry.gif&quot; alt=&quot;cry&quot; /&gt;</body>

			<body>As far as I know, the additional attack granted by an &quot;Add Target&quot; from an Attack Modifier doesn't interrupt the processing of the targets of the original attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way I see it, when a multi-target attack ability is executed, the intended targets are essentially queued up, and each attack in the queue is processed in full (including attack effects, any retaliates triggered by the attack, and additional abilities), and then the next target in queue is attacked, with that attack being processed in full, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;If at any time, an &quot;Add Target&quot; AttMod is processed, the additional target would be chosen right away and added at the end of the queue, but the actual attack against that target would not occur until after all the attacks against the original targets were processed.  (of course, if at any time, the attacker is killed/exhausted by a retaliate, then subsequent attacks would not occur.</body>

			<body>I believe that's the way everyone plays it, but it's not explicit anywhere (I've just checked the rulebook and FAQs). It's certainly the way I think it should be played.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an area where Add Target works differently to an area attack. In an area attack, all attacks would take place, regardless of whether retaliate exhausts the attacker. For Add Target, if retaliate exhausts an attacker, no additional targets would be attacked.</body>

			<body>I think it might work out if you treat step 3 as the first part of applying the focus rules to rank additional targets (and reword it to make this clear), but don't use that step to filter out destination hexes (only to filter out target sets). And then add a step 6 which actually takes the remaining destination hexes which can be reached in the least amount of steps. That would make the entire multi-target procedure analogous to a single target. For a single target, we've got:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Find the enemy which can be reached with the least amount of movement.&lt;br/&gt;2. Break ties on proximity.&lt;br/&gt;3. Break ties on initiative.&lt;br/&gt;4. Let players choose a focus if there's still a tie.&lt;br/&gt;5. Avoid disadvantage if possible.&lt;br/&gt;6. Move as little as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then for multi-targets we'd have (starting after 5. in the previous list):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. Attack as many extra targets as possible.&lt;br/&gt;7. Pick the target set which can be reached with the least amount of movement.&lt;br/&gt;8. Break ties on proximity to the additional targets.&lt;br/&gt;9. Break ties on initiative of the additional targets.&lt;br/&gt;10. Let players choose a target set if there's still a tie. (? this was never brought up, but it would make sense for consistency with single-target attacks.)&lt;br/&gt;10. Avoid disadvantage on as many targets in the target set if possible.&lt;br/&gt;11. Move as little as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this, 7-10 would be the &quot;using the focus rules&quot; and correspond exactly to 1-4.</body>

At this point, unless there is something way off that needs to be corrected, I would suggest any remaining ambiguity is resolved via the &quot;player's choice&quot; rule.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry to bother you with this again, Alex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<![CDATA[<div style=''><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/4213745"><img src="https://cf.geekdo-images.com/small/img/q_rYjlKEtypyDLq78vfW90WTaIU=/fit-in/200x150/pic4213745.png" border=0></a></div>]]>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red has Move 5, Attack Range 2, Target 3&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the current order it would move to (b). I just to want to varify that that's the intention? Edit: I am not saying it doesn't make sense (since that is the way it works with the primary focus after all). I am just double checking. &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the order below it would move to (a):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1st - Attack its primary focus, losing/avoiding disadvantage if possible&lt;br/&gt;2nd - Attack as many extra targets as possible&lt;br/&gt;3rd - Lose disadvantage on the extra targets (all equal priority, players decide ties)&lt;br/&gt;4th - Use the least amount of movement points from where all targets can be attacked.&lt;br/&gt;5th - If there are still multiple attack locations with an equal number of different extra targets use proximity (first), initiative (second) from its starting position to determine which secondary target (in addition to the previous target(s)) should be included in the attack (repeating for a tertiary target, etc.) and select the attack location which includes these targets. (no need to check movement points here since it is done in the 4th priority step already)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would move to B.</body>

			<body>Alright, here's what I could dig up. Here's a list of all instances of &quot;action&quot; which I think should be replaced with &quot;ability&quot;. Not all of them are technically wrong, depending on how you interpret the sentence, but I think using &quot;ability&quot; would still be clearer in these cases. I'll leave the judgement call of which of these are critical enough to mention in the FAQ to you though:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;p. 9: A monster’s movement value, the base number of hexes a monster can move with a Move &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;p. 9: A monster’s attack value, the base amount of damage the monster does with an Attack &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;p. 9: A “–” as the range value signifies the monster’s normal Attack &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt; can only target adjacent hexes (i.e., a melee attack).&lt;br/&gt;p. 14: A trap can also be disarmed through specific &lt;b&gt;actions&lt;/b&gt; to remove it from the board without suffering its negative effects. &lt;br/&gt;p. 17: Lost cards can only be returned to a player’s hand during a scenario by using a special recover &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;p. 17: The resting character also performs a “Heal 2, Self” &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt; and refreshes all of his or her spent item cards.&lt;br/&gt;p. 18: When a monster type takes an action, each monster of that type will perform the &lt;b&gt;actions&lt;/b&gt; listed on their played ability card, starting with elites and then normal monsters in ascending standee order. &lt;br/&gt;p. 21: Also note that each target constitutes a separate attack (drawing its own attack modifier card), but all attacks together make up a single &lt;b&gt;attack action&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;p. 27: This &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt; is unaffected by the positions of monsters or obstacles, but note this is considered a ranged ability for the purposes of line-of-sight.&lt;br/&gt;p. 29: Monsters’ decisions are controlled by a system of action cards that automate what the monsters will do on their turn in the initiative order. They are not controlled by a separate player. All monsters will perform the &lt;b&gt;actions&lt;/b&gt; listed on their ability card for the round in the order written. They will not move or attack unless these &lt;b&gt;actions&lt;/b&gt; are listed on their card.&lt;br/&gt;p. 29: Before performing any &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt; on their ability card, each individual monster will focus on a specific enemy—either a character or character summon.&lt;br/&gt;p. 30: In the case where there are no valid targets on which to focus, because there are no valid hexes a monster can attack from (i.e., they are all blocked, occupied, or there is no open path to reach them), regardless of the number of hexes it could move, a monster will not move or attack on its turn, but it will perform any of the other &lt;b&gt;actions&lt;/b&gt; on its ability card that it is able.&lt;br/&gt;p. 31: Monsters do not perform end-of-turn looting, but some monsters do have loot &lt;b&gt;actions&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;p. 32: If the rules ever make any monster &lt;b&gt;action&lt;/b&gt; ambiguous because there are multiple viable hexes to which the monster could move, multiple equally viable targets to heal or attack, or multiple hexes a monster could push or pull a character into, the players must decide which option the monster will take.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There also five instances of &quot;action card&quot; instead of &quot;ability card&quot;, but there's little risk for confusion here, so it's probably easier to just treat those two as synonyms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I've also found two instances of &quot;ability&quot; which would be clearer as &quot;ability card&quot; (and I think it's used as a shorthand of the latter here):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;p. 7: The name of the &lt;b&gt;ability&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;p. 25: The Spellweaver plays her Frost Armor &lt;b&gt;ability&lt;/b&gt;, which negates the next two sources of damage against her&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</body>

			<body>I made another pass over the rule book, this time looking for usage of the &quot;attack&quot; keyword. There's quite a few which I think should be &quot;attack action&quot; or &quot;attack ability&quot; and in the process I also found a couple more instances &quot;attack action&quot; which I think should be &quot;attack ability&quot; (in the definition of ADD TARGET).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;p. 11: Any time an Attack ability is performed, a separate attack modifier card is drawn for each individual target of the &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [ability].&lt;br/&gt;p. 20: Repeat these steps for each individual enemy targeted by the &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability or action]:&lt;br/&gt;p. 21: This &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability] indicates that the figure can perform a ranged “Attack 4” on a cluster of three hexes as long as at least one of those hexes is within Range 3.&lt;br/&gt;p. 21: This &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability] indicates that the figure can perform a melee “Attack 3” on the cluster of three hexes.&lt;br/&gt;p. 21: Some &lt;b&gt;attacks&lt;/b&gt; [attack abilities] are accompanied by a “Target X” value, which means the character can target X number of different enemies within the &lt;b&gt;attack’s&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability's] range with the &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [ability].&lt;br/&gt;p. 21: For any &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability] that targets multiple enemies, an attack modifier card is drawn for each target.&lt;br/&gt;p. 21: An ally can be within the affected area of an &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability], but they will not be targeted by it.&lt;br/&gt;p. 22: If a figure triggers this effect with an &lt;b&gt;attack action&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability], the figure may add an additional target within range to their &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability]. All added effects and conditions of the &lt;b&gt;attack action&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability] are applied to the target, as well, except for effects that would result in additional targets outside of the original added target (e.g., area attacks).&lt;br/&gt;p. 30: If it is a single-target melee &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability], it will simply move toward the nearest hex adjacent to its focus to attack.&lt;br/&gt;p. 30: If it is a multi-target &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability], it will move toward a position where its &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability or attacks] will hit its focused enemy and as many other enemies as possible.&lt;br/&gt;p. 30: If it had a single-target melee &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability], it would move 1 hex to be adjacent to the Brute and attack.&lt;br/&gt;p. 30: If it could attack two targets with a melee &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability], it would move 2 hexes to be adjacent to both the Brute and the Tinkerer.&lt;br/&gt;p. 46: The new hex becomes an additional target of the &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability].&lt;br/&gt;p. 47: 200g divided by the number of hexes currently targeted with the &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability].&lt;br/&gt;p. 47: The Brute wishes to enhance the top action of his ability card with a +1 on the &lt;b&gt;attack&lt;/b&gt; [attack ability].&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again, not all of these are critical, but I think especially the definition of &quot;ADD TARGET&quot; is a bit misleading. (I started looking into this after a discussion on reddit, where someone thought pulling an ADD TARGET modifier card ends up attacking two targets with the same attack without drawing a new modifier.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It also looks like &quot;area attack&quot; is generally used to mean &quot;area attack ability&quot; (so I haven't listed those above).</body>

			<body>Hey folks,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks very much for your work on this FAQ. It's awesome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After reading lots of this forum, doing the quiz, etc, it appears that the consensus is that we determine the &quot;closest&quot; character for monster focus by using movement points and not simply number of hexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is this true?  If so, the section of the FAQ discussing focus doesn't really make that clear at all. It keeps referring to number of spaces and distance, never mentioning movement points at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Next, find the minimum &lt;b&gt;distance&lt;/b&gt; it needs to move to get within range&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the case where the monster can move the same &lt;b&gt;number of spaces&lt;/b&gt; to get within range (and line-of-sight) of multiple enemies...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later, in the movement section, when it refers to using the &quot;focus rules&quot; for additional targets, it says movement points should be used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;If there are still multiple attack locations with an equal number of different extra targets, use the focus rules (&lt;b&gt;least amount of movement points*&lt;/b&gt;, then proximity, then initiative)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Should the Focus section of the FAQ be changed to reflect this?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks very much!</body>

			<body>Alex,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just now we had a question if infusions from attack modifier cards can be skipped. Since &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/25610134#25610134&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt; this question has been answered before by Isaac&lt;/a&gt;, could it be added to the FAQ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following question also came up:&lt;br/&gt;When a monster ability card has an elemental consumption to augment a single ability, and that ability can't be performed, will the element still be consumed?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Monster ability spoiler:&lt;br/&gt;[o]Flame Demon&lt;br/&gt;Attack +0&lt;br/&gt;Consume flame: 7-hex AoE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If none of the Flame Demons have a valid target, and therefore cannot perform the attack, will they still consume the flame?[/o]&lt;br/&gt;We searched the forums and found a number of threads discussing the subject, and the crowd seems to be about 50-50 on it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It would be nice if there could be an official answer in the FAQ about this as well.</body>

Rather, people think that the monster &lt;b&gt;can't&lt;/b&gt; use it. Why would they think that? Well, because the rules are clear that for player ability cards with similar wordings, it is not permitted to use the element unless you're actually performing the ability that's to be enhanced. Why would it secretly not work the same for monsters?</body>

And it might be good to add a bullet point to the skippable-effects entry that effects due to charges on persistent abilities cannot be skipped for the sake of completeness.[/o]</body>

			<body>FAQ Update&lt;br/&gt;-------&lt;br/&gt;Added entry noting that monster ability card's are not shuffled when all have been destroyed and new ones of that type are revealed (it's clear in the rule book IMO but it keeps being asked)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added item to non-skippable abilities entry: Charge of a multi-use ability or item if its conditions have been met.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other open questions are still under review.</body>

			<body>From early in the FAQ:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Are there any adjacency restrictions on what I can target with a melee area attack (area attack containing a grey hex)?&lt;br/&gt;The only restriction is that you have to have line of sight on a figure to target it with an attack. Other than that, if the hex is in the configuration shown on the card, you can attack it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does this mean that you CAN attack non-adjacent enemies with a MELEE AoE?&lt;br/&gt;The manual doesn't specifically say so, and the example on page 21 depicts such an attack as well.&lt;br/&gt;I always thought that at least ONE enemy needs to be adjacent in order for the attack to work. Have I been doing this wrong the whole time?&lt;br/&gt;If so, can a line be added explicitly stating that Yes, you CAN hit non-adjacent enemies with a melee AOE attack?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps this was clear for everyone else but I seem to have missed this.</body>

If you look at the puzzles notches around the edge of the map, they also imply that the connectors below the overlay tiles in the centre both need to be female. (Which is consistent with how the artwork is printed onto the actual map tiles.)</body>

			<body>Another thing, Alex, could you chime in on &lt;a href=&quot;/article/29572985#29572985&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;this discussion&lt;/a&gt;? There's some dispute over whether stuff which modifies an attack value (like poison or power potions) &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; attack modifier cards are drawn gets taken into account when evaluating 2x for advantage/disadvantage. The FAQ seems to be implying it isn't, and there's some debate over whether that's actually intended.</body>

I saw you also amended the bullet points for charges in the skippable abilities entry. In that case, I think the FAQ should state explicitly somewhere that this is an errata to the rule book, which says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Players &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; use the benefits of a persistent bonus when possible, even if no benefit is gained.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And you might also want to add the same clarification to this entry on items with charges:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Item cards with circles to track multiple uses act exactly like persistent ability cards, in that if the situation applies, you must use the item in reaction and lose a charge.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(So something like &quot;..., you must lose a charge in reaction and you may choose whether or not to apply the item's effect&quot;.)</body>

			<body>This one came from a slight debate on the table top simulator mod forum &lt;br/&gt;(&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1301493206&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13014...&lt;/a&gt;) regarding what should be open info when setting up the map. So I got confirmation from Isaac about a previous ruling which for some reason wasn't in the FAQ. By the way, for anyone looking to play the game remotely, the guys did an insane job on the Mod. They've recently added scripting for several game play elements, including automated scenario setup which is what prompted this question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: Fixed the link (was pointing to a mod for a different game)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FAQ Update&lt;br/&gt;----------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added entry to the scenario setup section noting what is open and closed info when setup up the map tiles. The intent is that only the 1st room's contents should be examined.</body>

			<body>About &lt;b&gt;Push&lt;/b&gt;, the FAQ doesn't mention anything about directionality.&lt;br/&gt;The Rule book however states this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;The target is forced to move X hexes in a direction specified by the attacker, but each hex moved must place the target farther away from the attacker than it was previously.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can we get a clarification on whether or not Push is meant to be executed in a single direction, or does a target get pushed 'around' an obstacle if free hexes exist? &lt;br/&gt;Basically, the question is 'does Push work in a SINGLE(straight) direction, or can the target be pushed in a non-straight path?'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming from another thread about the Cragheart, this could significantly impact(ha) its Obstacle builds and Ability cards.</body>

			<body>Is it possible to get an official clarification on how lineages interact with players creating new characters without retiring their old ones? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This has come up in various ways in a few threads, here and on reddit: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/29466268#29466268&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/29466268#29466268&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28819328&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28819328&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28876145&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28876145&lt;/a&gt; ,&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1974572/different-characters-party&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1974572/different-character...&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/29597090&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/29597090&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Gloomhaven/comments/942wt6/im_officially_really_confused_about_how_the/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Gloomhaven/comments/942wt6/im_offic...&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Gloomhaven/comments/941jdw/question_about_retirement_and_character_swapping/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Gloomhaven/comments/941jdw/question...&lt;/a&gt; , probably others too. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think the core of the question is &quot;if you create two characters but only play one of them at a time, do they have to be in different lineages or can they be in the same one?&quot; but in general it would be good to have a better explanation of what exactly is meant by a lineage. </body>

			<body>A lineage is a direct descendancy of retired and new characters as chosen by the player. If you rolled up two characters at the beginning of the campaign and are playing them together in one session or alternating them between sessions, they each have their own lineage. When one retires, the next character you start can either be their own new lineage or part of the one that retires, your choice. If you want the perk, you'll want to make it part of the lineage. It's just about whether you want the free perk or not.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: I should probably add that to the FAQ huh?</body>

			<body>Having that in the FAQ would be great, but I believe the question is how is lineage handled when someone stops playing a character without a formal retirement (ie. without reaching their personal goal).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, suppose I start with the Cragheart, reach my personal goal, retire and create a Tinkerer. After playing a few sessions as a Tinkerer, I decide I don't like him and want to create a MindThief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Mindthief in the same lineage as the Cragheart (ie. get one starting perk) or is it the start of a new lineage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I complete the Mindthief's personal goal and create a Brute, how many perks does the Brute start with?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I stop playing the Brute (without completing the personal goal) and decide to go back to the Tinkerer I stopped playing earlier, complete the Tinkerer's personal goal, and create a Scoundrel, how many perks does the Scoundrel start with?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything is straightforward if we always complete personal goals, but if someone doesn't like playing a character and decides to create a new one without a formal retirement, it all gets rather complicated...</body>

			<subject>Re: Official FAQ for Game Revs 1 and 2 (no rules questions please)</subject>
			<body>The three ways I've seen lineage thought of:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Lineage = characters as if associated with a modifier deck. I always play Deck 1, all my characters always are played only by me and play deck 1 (so never two characters from the same lineage in a scenario), and all I need to keep track of is how many characters I've retired. So if I create a Brute, quit him and create a Tinkerer, play Tinkerer to retirement, then play Brute to retirement, create a new character - I've retired two characters so the next guy would have two perks. The only thing needed to track is how many characters I've retired. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Lineage = Family Tree, like one of those branching things. First I play a Brute, retire him... next I create a Tinkerer (son of Brute = 1 perk). I don't retire Tinkerer, create Scoundrel (son of Brute = 1 perk). When I retire either Tinkerer or Scoundrel, I could make the next character their son by lineage and would get 2 perks, but even if I come back to the other and retire both Tinkerer and Scoundrel later, each would have its own lineage now and I would never be able to use the bonus perks from each retirement on the same new character. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Lineage = straight line of characters by retirement. I create a Brute, retire him and create a Tinkerer (1 perk). If I don't like the Tinkerer, my replacement character has to be made with 0 perks, since it's a new lineage. (In this example there was 1 bonus perk lost, but it could be 6 bonus perks lost if you don't like the character you created.)  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For 2 and 3, what I'd need to track is which character is the parent of which other character, and how many perks each character started with. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The reason this is confusion, for me, is there is because in the rulebook, the only thing it says you need to track (and the only thing there's space to track in the town records book) is how many characters you've retired. And yet, it seems like a common/reasonable thing (and seems to be encouraged by the rulebook!) for players to try a character and realize they don't like the class and want to do something else instead. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[edit] Just thought of option number 4. It's like the option 3, except with the option to Stop Playing a character without retiring them. So if I play a Brute to retirement, create a Tinkerer (1 bonus perk), realize that I don't want to play Tinkerer, I can remove them and create some other character with 1 perk. But if I decide I'm just putting Tinkerer on hold for a bit rather than killing them off, then the new character has to start with 0 perks. </body>

After playing a few sessions as a Tinkerer, I decide I don't like him and want to create a MindThief.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Mindthief in the same lineage as the Cragheart (ie. get one starting perk) or is it the start of a new lineage?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I complete the Mindthief's personal goal and create a Brute, how many perks does the Brute start with?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If I stop playing the Brute (without completing the personal goal) and decide to go back to the Tinkerer I stopped playing earlier, complete the Tinkerer's personal goal, and create a Scoundrel, how many perks does the Scoundrel start with?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everything is straightforward if we always complete personal goals, but if someone doesn't like playing a character and decides to create a new one without a formal retirement, it all gets rather complicated...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Per the rules, you need to retire a character to get the perk on the next character in the lineage. The perk is the reward for playing the character through to retirement. If you don't retire them and quit playing them before your personal goal is met, you don't get the perk.</body>

			<body>Apologies - I know his isn't the right place to get into this in such detail, but just wanting to clear up the example from CrashTestDummy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe this is the example that you're pushing for? (Perks in brackets)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;         Cragheart (0)&lt;br/&gt;          /     \&lt;br/&gt;  Tinkerer (1)   \&lt;br/&gt;        /       Mindthief (1)&lt;br/&gt;       /           \&lt;br/&gt;      /           Brute (2)&lt;br/&gt;Scoundrel (2/3?)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Personally, I'd disagree with this practice and go with &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1974572/article/28818019#28818019&quot;   &gt;Morthai's summary&lt;/a&gt;, whereby lineages can &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; be continued through retirement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cragheart (0)&lt;br/&gt;    |&lt;br/&gt;Tinkerer (1)&lt;br/&gt;    |             Mindthief (0)&lt;br/&gt;    |                 |&lt;br/&gt;    |               Brute (1)&lt;br/&gt;Scoundrel (2)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The confusion comes due to the RaW use of the word &lt;i&gt;Player&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-Post from &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2032700/article/29681420#29681420&quot;   &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Re. the term 'player' - The rulebook states &quot;e.g. Solo play&quot; 'e.g.' indicating that this is not an exhaustive list.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a 1:1 relationship between character lineage and player, but there may be a *:* (many to many) relationship between actual person(s) and player (to accommodate letting a guest play as your character on game night).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So any time a person has taken ownership of a character, they are considered a different player, even with respects to other characters they may be playing with.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As soon as you lock a specific person in as a player of a character/lineage, you get into all sorts of wacky situations re. retirements and perks if you happen to let a guest play as a character at the time the character retires.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simplest way to think of it is if you have infinite attack modifier decks. Every time a new lineage is created, that lineage uses deck n+1 and this represents a single player of which perks are tracked against.&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>I wonder if BGG has localized-admin capability, where there could be a Thread where Replies were locked, and only designated people could comment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That would allow a clean FAQ thread, where only Alex (and Isaac, or any others deemed &quot;official&quot;) could add replies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of course, it might be handy to have a separate thread for open discussion,   But having the actual FAQ page remain clean would be better.</body>

			<body>I agree it could be a bit more specific. How about this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster will use the shortest path (least movement points) that it can traverse to reach the destination hex. If it can't reach the destination hex this turn, it will move to get as close as possible to that hex along that path. </body>

It may be able to get closer to the target hex along a different path. Ultimately, we're talking about the situation where the shortest path to the target hex is through allies that the monster doesn't have enough current movement to get through, right? So very often, the monster could get closer to the target hex by going around those allies. If you constrain the path choice to the actual shortest path to that hex, which is what the &quot;along that path&quot; phrase is doing, they could end up sitting behind allies and not getting as close to the target hex as they could.</body>

			<body>I see. I don't think that adds much clarity, because it still initially sounds like you're picking a path and sticking to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I honestly wonder what the need for the whole &quot;shortest path&quot; clause even is. Trying to come up with a situation where it would actually make a functional difference than if the rules had just said &quot;the monster will try to get as close as possible to its destination space&quot; without any mention of taking the shortest path.</body>

I think the &quot;shortest path&quot; terminology is meant to make it clear that this should not happen, but I think &quot;using the least movement&quot; might be a better alternative.</body>

			<body>How about this:&lt;br/&gt;The monster will use the shortest path (the one that uses the least movement points) to reach the destination hex. If it can't reach the destination hex this turn, it will move along the shortest path to the destination hex that it can traverse this turn to get as close as possible to that hex.</body>

			<body>The &quot;it can traverse&quot; seems unnecessarily complicated to interpret to me. What about something like:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster will use the shortest path (the one that uses the least movement points) to reach the destination hex. If it can't reach the destination hex this turn, it will take the shortest path which brings it as close as possible to the destination hex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(I'm also worried that talking about a shortest path to the destination hex misses the weird cases with jump, where both the final hex of this turn's movement and the final hex of the infinite movement to the destination hex count as two steps, but I don't have the time right now to come up with an example where that actually makes a difference.)</body>

Alternately, I would propose getting rid of &quot;shortest path&quot; completely as that seems to be where the hang up is.  Is there a reason to include it (there may be, I just can't think of a situation where it matters) rather than simply saying something like:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster moves to the destination hex.  If this is not possible, the monster moves as close to that hex as possible.  </body>

			<body>Lol it's a technicality, but yeah, when you are referring to something quantifiable (&quot;movement &lt;i&gt;points&lt;/i&gt;&quot; vs. the more abstract &quot;movement&quot;), it's proper to use few/fewer/fewest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That being said, absolutley no one will misunderstand (or care much) if you don't. </body>

This is not a change to the movement rules. It's just to make it clear that it will chose the shortest path around allies that block it's movement.</body>

In relation to Massive Boulder I've seen this question pop up a couple of times, but it's also relevant to XP gain, elemental infusion, self heals etc. Basically, the rule book says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Any additional effects of an attack are not applied once a monster dies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the question is whether this means &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; additional effects, all effects that would affect the dead monster, or all effects except a few whitelisted ones?</body>

			<body>Target X attack abilities are treated no different to those with hex patterns defining the target area.  Item 33 can not be used in either to stop you targetting the same enemy twice with a single attack ability, which you could do if two enemies were next to each other.</body>

			<body>Volker's question above was resolved, but in &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2054195/interaction-target-x-abilities-and-items&quot;   &gt;the thread he started&lt;/a&gt;, I raised another question which I don't think is addressed by the FAQ so far:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;However, if it's an actual &quot;Target X&quot; (where X depends on something), I'm not sure whether it wouldn't count as single-target whenever X=1. I would probably rule it so that it is in fact treated as a single-target attack action for the purposes of items and active abilities in that case.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could you maybe chime in there or check with Isaac? (I realise these are multi-target for the purposes of enhancing, but my reasoning is that during actual play that X will always have a specific value, which may be 1.)</body>

			<body>And something else, could &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1740102/scenario-71-question&quot;   &gt;this ruling&lt;/a&gt; be added to the FAQ? Ideally both parts separately: a) ignoring negative scenario effects is mandatory when you have the perk, b) the effect of scenario 71 is indeed a negative effect. And while we're at it, could the FAQ clarify whether character summons get the benefit of this perk? (I assume not, but I haven't found any official statement.)</body>

			<body>Hi Alex, you are doing fantastic job here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would you please add more examples to the advantage and disadvantage rules clarification, as per Isaac’s input in this thread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/24302267#24302267&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/24302267#24302267&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I just explained it to my group as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advantage. Draw just two cards only! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they are both normal cards then apply the better card. If ambiguous then apply the FIRST card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If they are both rolling modifiers then keep drawing until you get a normal card. In this case apply ALL cards drawn. DO NOT then draw a second “result”. This is the same effect as if this was a normal attack, so no better than normal. Note that if you draw a null then you do no damage but get the non-numeric effects of the rolling modifiers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; If the first card is a normal card and the second card is a rolling modifier then apply them both, as if this was not advantage and as if the rolling modifier was drawn first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disadvantage. Draw just two cards only! Ignore rolling modifiers and apply the other card. If both are rolling modifiers then keep drawing until a non-rolling modifier appears. Apply that card, even if it is a bless or doubler!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With rolling modifiers you can get better results with disadvantage than is logical and a null result when you have advantage!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isaac has stuck by his rules and argued that the contradictions in logic even each other out.</body>

			<body>The example where the rolling modifier is drawn second. Explain that this works as if it is a normal attack, as if the rolling modifier was drawn first. This is better than a normal result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Explain that multiple rolling modifiers followed by a normal modifier is the same as a normal attack result but not worse. Even if a null/curse is pulled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An advantage result is always equal to or better than a normal result, even if it is null/curse (the curse/null result would be equal to a normal result).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A disadvantage result is always equal to or worse than a normal result because all the rolling modifiers are ignored, even if a bless/doubler comes out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks </body>

			<body>Speaking of advantage/disadvantage: could we get some ruling on what counts as &quot;attack value&quot; for the 2x attack modifiers when deciding which attack modifier card is better or worse? &lt;br/&gt;The discussion took place in &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2027694/advantage-disadvantage-reference&quot;   &gt;Sadgit's &quot;Advantage-Disadvantage Reference&quot; thread&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2027694/article/29567192#29567192&quot;   &gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2027694/article/29578087#29578087&quot;   &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and is still unresolved afaik. My very compressed summary of what the argument is about would be: some ppl are saying that &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- only the base attack value is used for this check and all additional effects that would influence the attack value (poison, item effects etc.) are disregarded (that's what it's currently saying on on Sadgit's reference sheet and what some ppl infer from the current wording of the FAQ on this topic)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;others argue that&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- &quot;attack value&quot; refers to the attack value from the 1st step of  resolving an attack (rulebook p.20) - which takes into account if an enemy is e.g. poisoned or whether e.g. a power potion was used - as the drawing of the attack modifier card happens only in the 2nd step.</body>

			<body>Hi Alex,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could we take a definite ruling from Isaac whether a player that donates before retiring his/her character can add the bless cards to the new character's modifier deck?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook states that it should be the player that donates, thus making it possible to 'transfer' the bless cards to his/her new character.&lt;br/&gt;But maybe it was not written accurately and was meant to be each &lt;b&gt;&quot;character&quot;&lt;/b&gt; instead of each player.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rulebook ref.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DONATING TO THE SANCTUARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once per visit to Gloomhaven, each player can donate 10 gold to the Sanctuary of the Great Oak, a temple and hospital in the city. Doing so allows the donating player to add two BLESS attack modifier cards to their attack modifier deck for the next scenario.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also please see some relevant threads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1951438/can-you-sell-your-items-and-donate-retirement&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1951438/can-you-sell-your-i...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1747344/getting-close-retirement-what-do-gold/page/2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1747344/getting-close-retir...&lt;/a&gt;</body>

Monsters can't skip abilities and do perform the infusion even if they can't perform another ability on their ability card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added entry noting retiring characters that donate to the sanctuary can't give the bless cards to their new character</body>

Monsters must do the infusion as well, but the wording in the book does imply somewhat that they can skip it. Though the rule book is explicit elsewhere that monsters can't skip any of their abilities. And I'm not sure why there is a problem considering an infusion as an ability. They just have some special case rules called out in the FAQ and book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit. The rulebook would be definitely clearer there if it said &quot;character&quot; instead of figure.</body>

The wording in the rule book implies that there is no such thing as skipping infusions. There is no choice involved with infusions: either you perform at least one ability, in which case the infusion always happens, or you don't in which case it doesn't. Applying that same rule to monsters doesn't make them &quot;skip the infusion&quot;, the infusion would just not be available when no abilities are performed (since the infusion is attached to the actual abilities of the action).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;And I'm not sure why there is a problem considering an infusion as an ability.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanding my previous quote of the rule book by another sentence:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some abilities have an elemental affinity associated with them (either Fire, Ice, Air, Earth, Light, or Dark). If any of these symbols is visible by itself in an action’s description (a), it means that by performing any part of the action, the figure must infuse the battlefield with that element.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This sounds like infusions are a special property of the action and/or its abilities, just like XP gain is. The elemental infusion is &quot;associated with the abilities&quot;.</body>

Now it's possible that he just changed his mind, but I wonder whether both of those rulings are correct? The rest is spoilers for Music Note and Scenario 83:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]The difference between those two situations is that the older ruling is about performing a Heal 1 action at the beginning of your turn, whereas the newer one is about a scenario effect described as &quot;All monsters heal 1 damage at the start of their turn&quot;. The wording of the latter seems to me like it's just an effect, and that no actual Heal 1 ability or action is performed. So maybe the idea was that these non-ability effects trigger &quot;at the same time&quot; as wound and other beginning-of-turn effects, so players choose. But the Music Note card specifically says that the allies perform an action, which according to the older ruling can't happen before beginning-of-turn effects. I also think this interpretation would be consistent with the fact that end-of-turn actions happen before other end-of-turn effects.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;Could you maybe double check this and then clarify the FAQ entry accordingly?</body>

It specifically says what it means to create an element during your turn, the exact wording on that item.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can you explain the timing of elemental infusions?&lt;br/&gt;Yes, the main take-away here is that any elements you create on your turn do not get moved to the strong column until the end of your turn. This means that you cannot create an element (that wasn't already present) and then consume it on the same turn because it won't be available to be consumed until the end of your turn. On the up side, this also means that if an element is already strong or waning at the start of your turn, you can create the element again with your first action, consume the existing element with your second action, and then the element will still go up to strong at the end of your turn even though you just used it.</body>

			<body>That FAQ entry doesn't use the word &quot;during&quot;, like the item does. It's easy to misread that item as using that wording specifically to say you get the element earlier than you normally would. This is exactly the kind of thing that should be in the FAQ in my opinion. The general FAQ entry is less useful because that information is already in the rulebook. The FAQ is useful for clarifying individual cards whose wordings may or may not create an exception to the normal rules.</body>

			<body>Hi Alex, just wanted to follow up on our earlier discussion:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;aflorin wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color=#0B5C0D&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;m_ender wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color=#6F0C0C&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;aflorin wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Clarified the stand-alone infusion entry in the skipable abilities section that the rule applies to characters and not monsters. Monsters can't skip abilities and do perform the infusion even if they can't perform another ability on their ability card.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could this be highlighted as an errata? I don't think there's any support for this in the rule book. For a start, I don't think the rule book even makes it clear that infusion is an ability. It's presented as a special property of an action or ability indicated by an icon instead of a keyword, and it clearly doesn't work like a normal ability (for characters anyway), since it's not independent of the other abilities on the card.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rule book also says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#6F0C0C&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;If any of these symbols is visible by itself in an action’s description (a), it means that &lt;b&gt;by performing any part of the action, the figure&lt;/b&gt; must infuse the battlefield with that element.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That also indicates that the infusion itself is not &quot;any part of the action&quot; and it seems to deliberately include monsters.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically the part you quote is true though it could be better worded as per the FAQ (which IMO isn't an errata - more like a clarification). Monsters must do the infusion as well, but the wording in the book does imply somewhat that they can skip it. Though the rule book is explicit elsewhere that monsters can't skip any of their abilities. And I'm not sure why there is a problem considering an infusion as an ability. They just have some special case rules called out in the FAQ and book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit. The rulebook would be definitely clearer there if it said &quot;character&quot; instead of figure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While searching for something else, I just accidentally stumbled over &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26284314#26284314&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;this comment from Isaac&lt;/a&gt;, confirming that elemental infusion is not an ability but a property of an action (or ability when it's attached to one I guess), like XP gain or card loss is. I think that gives further support to my interpretation that elemental infusion works exactly the same for monsters as for players: there's no &quot;skipping&quot; the elemental infusion, but whether it happens or not purely depends on whether abilities on the action are being performed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Ignore this if you already double-checked this with Isaac, but from your previous messages I got the impression that this FAQ change was your own interpretation of the rules here.)</body>

			<body>Ah okay, thanks for clarifying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I still think this should be marked as an errata. (I would assume that Isaac's new ruling doesn't change the fact that infusions are not abilities.) With this ruling, characters and monsters clearly have different infusion mechanics, and all the rule book says is that monsters can also infuse elements like characters. Plus, like you said, the sentence I quoted should have &quot;figures&quot; replaced with &quot;characters&quot;.</body>

			<body>Could you add an entry explicitly addressing when monsters re-evaluate their focus? The only situation that is addressed is a monster hitting a single enemy with multiple attacks which is addressed in &quot;Can you clarify how monsters do attacks against multiple targets?&quot;. But presumably the same is true if the focus dies from something that isn't an attack, but it's not clear whether the focus also gets re-evaluated if the focus becomes unattackable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relevant threads: &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2073910/when-do-monsters-choose-their-focus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2021679/can-monsters-without-multiple-attacks-re-evaluate/page/1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;</body>

E.g.:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt; # # # # #&lt;br/&gt;# . . . . #&lt;br/&gt; # - # - #&lt;br/&gt;# . X . P #&lt;br/&gt; # # # # #&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Player at P can put an obstacle at X, because you can get past X by going through the doors, so you aren't blocking off anything. Then if the door next to P was closed, the end of the room is unreachable due to the obstacle. This is still legal. If the door next to P was closed, then it would be illegal to put an obstacle at X, because placing the obstacle (not closing the door) is what would make the end of the room unreachable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Do I have that right?)</body>

			<body>Alex, last night we ran into some questions regarding scenario 78 that have been asked before but haven't been answered yet. Could you provide an answer to the answers of this thread:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2074657/scenario-78-rules-questions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2074657/scenario-78-rules-q...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And maybe it is also usefull to add the previously answered questions by Isaac to the FAQ from this thread:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1817047/scenario-78-visible-spoilers-thread&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1817047/scenario-78-visible...&lt;/a&gt;</body>

			<body>&lt;br/&gt;Alex, could you maybe add an official answer to the FAQ on some open questions about NPC movement of scenario 38:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1752469/npc-movement-scenario-38-spoilers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1752469/npc-movement-scenar...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have seen many questions about this coming up and recently someone had a similar question again so I think this scenario needs some official clarification in the FAQ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

The only situation that is addressed is a monster hitting a single enemy with multiple attacks which is addressed in &quot;Can you clarify how monsters do attacks against multiple targets?&quot;. But presumably the same is true if the focus dies from something that isn't an attack, but it's not clear whether the focus also gets re-evaluated if the focus becomes unattackable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relevant threads: &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2073910/when-do-monsters-choose-their-focus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2021679/can-monsters-without-multiple-attacks-re-evaluate/page/1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think this is still pending, and with the new Diviner cards that were released there are new edge cases to consider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]Haven't looked at all of them yet, but now it's fairly easy for a monster to become Disarmed halfway through their move, so would they switch to &quot;as if melee&quot; movement halfway through? Would the focus change accordingly?[/o]</body>

			<body>I think it would be good to add a clarification for abilities that outright kill enemies. From what I read in various threads, actions that allow characters to consume an element to &quot;instead&quot; kill an enemy still inherit the range component of the original ability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Examples (spoiler: names of a level 4 Spellweaver card and a level 1 Moon card) :&lt;br/&gt;[o]Spellweavers's Spirit of Doom or the Moon's Spirit of the Night[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, it would be great to add how these abilities interact with invisible enemies. Is the target requirement of modified attack abilities still relevant and thus invalidates the kill ability on invisible enemies? What if the original ability had no target component (such as in the example for the Spellweaver card)?</body>

We interpreted the ability with &quot;instead&quot; as being completely separate, and so ignored the range feature in the ability above it. So this was wrong? </body>

			<body>Alex, the current discussion around armour use when stunned highlights that the FAQ says something rather different from the rules. I. E. the rules say you can't use items while stunned (&quot;Any instance of you applying the effects of an item card to a situation is considered a use&quot; , says the rules what a use is), but the FAQ says you can use &quot;passive&quot; items while stunned (without defining &quot;passive&quot;).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Can we have some indication in the FAQ text to indicate the places it erratas the rules? They're their for R1 to R2 changes, but nothing later. </body>

			<body>Having just completed scenario 93, I would suggest putting an item into the FAQ for it pointing out that the entire entry row of the starting room is composed of water spaces.  It wasn't until after revealing the last room and asking &quot;Where do the other six water tiles go?&quot; that we noticed we had completely overlooked them since the character starting positions overlap with them.  In retrospect, we should've cued in on the purple outlines, but we hadn't played in a few weeks and so hadn't remembered that entry spaces don't typically have purple boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-Brad&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>There are several classes that have movement abilities or other non-attack abilities that can be improved by consuming an element, but there's no general ruling on the timing of the consumption like there is for consumption of elements on attack abilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's one ruling on a Triangles Level 1/X card in the FAQ now, but other classes and abilities also fit this case and so I think adding a general ruling may be useful (or at least adding it to all such abilities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This comes from this thread: &lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/30651172#30651172&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/article/30651172#30651172&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A couple specific abilities are called out there: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cragheart's Cataclysm &lt;/b&gt;Bottom has a Move+ from consumption (where the ruling is clear based on the ruling for Triangles but can't be seen as a Cragheart player that hasn't unlocked that ability, nor searched since it's behind a spoiler.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mindthief's Silent Scream&lt;/b&gt; Bottom gets a Push+ from consumption, but it's unclear if you can consume for a farther push after pushing one or more targets (so they only go 2 away, but others go 3).</body>

			<body>Hi,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;we have started a Gloomhaven Group in Germany and sometimes it happens that we are more than 4 Players present during a gaming session. we found a way to Play to with two parties in such way that for example either Party is playing a different Scenario (if it works out with the Monsters and Level tile) or one is playing the campaign and the other is playing a random Scenario. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;my question is: can we order just certain things from the gloomhaven game? because what we needed were:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-2 more decks of Player modifier Cards.&lt;br/&gt;-one more deck of Monster modifier Cards&lt;br/&gt;-the full package of bless and curse Cards (Monsters and Players)&lt;br/&gt;-the element cardboard plus the element Tokens&lt;br/&gt;-the envelopes for the Monsters card(the ones for 10 enemys and the ones for 6)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;it is possible to improvise the missing parts i am asking for with material from the gloomhaven box, but it would be easier if we could purchase the requested items.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;phillip&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>I'll be updating the FAQ soon with the recent rulings and answers. Sorry for the long delay, been busy and stuff piled up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regarding the definition of a Passive Item (usable while stunned), how does this sound?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Passive items are those whose effects trigger automatically when their requirements are met or whose effects take place immediately on scenario start (ex: Iron Helmet, Hide Armor, Second Skin)&lt;br/&gt;</body>

Maybe not second skin, as that's a found item (/edit there aren't any of those in the standard set. I think Cloak Of Pockets is the lowest prosperity one) . It might be worth saying the opposite as well, I. E. any item isn't passive when the player makes any choice about its activation. </body>

Then whenever their trigger condition is met (in the case of Hide Armor, that would be damage from an incoming attack), that token is moved one space to the right after applying the item effect (i.e. Shield 1 for the current attack), until eventually the token ends up on the &quot;spent&quot; symbol at which time that item becomes Spent.  (there may be similar items that have the Consumed symbol instead, I can't remember off the top of my head.  But it would follow the same procedure, just with the item being consumed at the end instead of spent)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So yes, it is &quot;fully passive, meaning the first 2 attacks against you after a long rest (and the first two attacks against you in a scenario) are shielded, unless all the damage from those attacks are mitigated by other means (in which case, the armor isn't used and the token isn't moved, because there is no longer any damage to trigger it)</body>

			<body>Yeah, as I understood it from the video, the new cards and the new rules were going to be in the next expansion (after Forgotten Circles). But it might also be the case that the next printing of the base game would include the change.</body>

			<body>I listened to the video, and it sounded like the change would not go into effect until the next large expansion.  So not official yet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(And there was web discussion that it may hit some characters harder than others, so there might need to be other tweaks to keep things balanced when this change goes into effect)</body>

			<body>He states that if people want to nerf the Stamina potions now, they can do so as it will become official when the expansion comes out. That's why I worded it as such in the FAQ.</body>

			<body>Hello. Could you clarify wether it's players choice to select or perk or not upon leveling up? The FAQ entry say you gain all benefits and you HAVE to level up, but rulebook says that upon leveling up you CAN choose a perk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So as far as I read - Perks are mandatory from battle goals, but optional from level ups as the rulebook uuses the word CAN rather than have to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Correct?</body>

So you gain it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#6F4C0C&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I choose not to level up when I have the experience or not gain a perk when I have three check marks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. If you are in town and you have enough experience to level up, you are forced to do so, immediately gaining all benefits of leveling up. If you have three check marks, you must immediately gain a perk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No that is not in the FAQ...&lt;br/&gt;It says you gain all the benefits of leveling up. It doesn't say you have to gain a perk however!! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have to understand, what is the benefit of leveling up? In order to understand that we read the rulebooks that states that ONE of the benefits of leveling up is that you CAN select a perk - Ergo, you are not required to take a perk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the benefit of leveling up = You CAN (implies choice) take a perk, + some other stuff that isn't relevant for this question (card selection etc.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must take the perk when leveling up, just like you have to take a perk when you have 3 check marks. &quot;Immediately gaining all benefits of leveling up&quot; is pretty clear.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't agree with you Alex, because according to the rulebook page 44, the benefit of leveling is NOT a perk, but that you CAN choose a perk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So either it's not clear at all (actually wrong?) or the FAQ has to be changed to make it clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know this isn't law, but there is a big implied meaning in the word CAN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let me put up an example. When you level up you get the benefits of leveling up, as stated in the FAQ, and these benefits ARE mandatory. Ok, so far we agree, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we have to determine what are the benefits of leveling up, so we know exactly which benefits that are MANDATORY for us to receive. So for this we refer to the rulebook page 44 - Leveling up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this segment it states that the benefits of leveling up are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Add one card to their active card pool. (+ some restrictions about level)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Additionally the player &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; set a mark on one of the perk boxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. And increase hit point total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ok, now we see that 3 things occur when leveling up. We must add a card, and we must increase hit point total, these two are NOT up for interpretation. Finally according to the rulebook page 44, then we &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; mark one of the perk boxes.&lt;br/&gt;Now, the word &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; implies choice - A choice of wether we want to add a perk or not.&lt;br/&gt;Had it not been a choice a word like SHALL or MUST, or simply omitting the word &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; would seal the deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wether this is intentional, I don't know - Which is why I'm pushing for clarification OR an ammended FAQ as to know wether it's RAW or houserule. 'Legal' or 'Illegal' gamestate.</body>

If you go to the campaign section, you will find it quite quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FAQ is maintained by Alex who directly asks the creator of the game.  So all entries in the FAQ are official clarifications, there are no houserules or guesses, Alex isn't making up an interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You have been provided with the answer.

The FAQ *doesn't* state that a level up perk is mandatory. Alex thinks that a level up perk *is* mandatory (and that he thinks the FAQ says so, though I respectfully disagree). I'd like Alex to check whether his understanding is correct, and adjust the FAQ accordingly.</body>

The FAQ clears up that leveling is mandatory AND so is the benefits. However according to the rulebook one of the benefits is that you &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; select a perk. This ambiguity has &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; been adressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also note, this is not a rules question as much as it is a clarification question of the FAQ. Should I create a new thread to ask for clarifications or change to FAQ entries??</body>

			<body>I'd add that as I type there's a whole Reddit thread in progress arguing that level up perks aren't mandatory, pointing at this very FAQ to back that argument. If they all think the FAQ says one thing but Alex thinks it says/should say another, then the FAQ needs clarification.</body>

Rulebook (that states one thing), a FAQ that doesn't correct what's stated in the rulebook, and then in the end another quick reference sheet saying that what's in the rulebook is wrong (or supposed to be interpreted in a different way than how the English language works).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's a mess. </body>

Could you clarify wether it's players choice to select or perk or not upon leveling up? The FAQ entry say you gain all benefits and you HAVE to level up, but rulebook says that upon leveling up you CAN choose a perk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So as far as I read - Perks are mandatory from battle goals, but optional from level ups as the rulebook uuses the word CAN rather than have to.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Correct?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is alread in the FAQ, gaining a perk is a benefit of leveling up. So you gain it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I choose not to level up when I have the experience or not gain a perk when I have three check marks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. If you are in town and you have enough experience to level up, you are forced to do so, immediately gaining all benefits of leveling up. If you have three check marks, you must immediately gain a perk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No that is not in the FAQ...&lt;br/&gt;It says you gain all the benefits of leveling up. It doesn't say you have to gain a perk however!! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have to understand, what is the benefit of leveling up? In order to understand that we read the rulebooks that states that ONE of the benefits of leveling up is that you CAN select a perk - Ergo, you are not required to take a perk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So the benefit of leveling up = You CAN (implies choice) take a perk, + some other stuff that isn't relevant for this question (card selection etc.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must take the perk when leveling up, just like you have to take a perk when you have 3 check marks. &quot;Immediately gaining all benefits of leveling up&quot; is pretty clear.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't agree with you Alex, because according to the rulebook page 44, the benefit of leveling is NOT a perk, but that you CAN choose a perk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So either it's not clear at all (actually wrong?) or the FAQ has to be changed to make it clear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I know this isn't law, but there is a big implied meaning in the word CAN.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let me put up an example. When you level up you get the benefits of leveling up, as stated in the FAQ, and these benefits ARE mandatory. Ok, so far we agree, right?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now we have to determine what are the benefits of leveling up, so we know exactly which benefits that are MANDATORY for us to receive. So for this we refer to the rulebook page 44 - Leveling up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this segment it states that the benefits of leveling up are the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Add one card to their active card pool. (+ some restrictions about level)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Additionally the player &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; set a mark on one of the perk boxes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. And increase hit point total.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ok, now we see that 3 things occur when leveling up. We must add a card, and we must increase hit point total, these two are NOT up for interpretation. Finally according to the rulebook page 44, then we &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; mark one of the perk boxes.&lt;br/&gt;Now, the word &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; implies choice - A choice of wether we want to add a perk or not.&lt;br/&gt;Had it not been a choice a word like SHALL or MUST, or simply omitting the word &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; would seal the deal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wether this is intentional, I don't know - Which is why I'm pushing for clarification OR an ammended FAQ as to know wether it's RAW or houserule. 'Legal' or 'Illegal' gamestate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'll update the FAQ to note the Rulebook should read &quot;MUST&quot; because definitely it is not optional&lt;br/&gt;</body>

[ERRATA] The rulebook should state &quot;MUST&quot; instead of &quot;CAN&quot; for the perk benefit. If you have three check marks, you must immediately gain a perk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clarified Monster Ability Cards entry noting when melee ability cards override a Range in the stat card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster ability card lists a melee attack (like a melee AoE or “target adjacent enemies” effects without a &quot;range&quot; specified) but the monster stat card specifies a Range X, is the attack melee or ranged?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is melee, the monster ability card takes precedence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clarified Monster Elements entry noting when an element consumption attached to a move or attack may be used&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a monster's element consumption is attached to another ability (like Attack or Move) and can't perform that ability (ex: disarmed or immobilized), is the element consumed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. However, if the consumption allows the original ability to take place (like Consume for +1 Range which then puts the attack in range) it means that the monster CAN perform the ability and consumes the element to do so.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt; </body>

			<body>On the old faq it was ruled that the ignore negative item effects perk was only for the -1 cards added &lt;a href=&quot;/article/25086212#25086212&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;in this comment&lt;/a&gt;. I see it has been added here as a side note to item 45, but other items should also be affected by this, like item 117 [o]bloody axe: During your melee attack, suffer 2 damage to add +1 Attack to the entire Attack action.[/o]. I would suggest an entry be added for the perk as a whole instead of adding an entry for each item with negative side effects.</body>

Only place the ones in the room that the characters start in.  Monsters in the other rooms aren't placed until that room is &quot;revealed&quot; (usually by a character opening a door into that room).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So yes, if 4 characters are playing scenario 10 and they rush all the way into the third room without killing any of the previously revealed Flame Demons, there will be one Flame Demon that doesn't get placed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think you may be overlooking the &quot;Fog&quot; tiles in that scenario, which act exactly like doors.</body>

			<body>This is a minor formatting issue, but just letting you know that some of the markup in the FAQ is messed up and needs fixing:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#2121A4&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;aflorin wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does the &quot;Ignore Negative Item Effects&quot; perk apply to any negative effects other than -1 Attack Modifier cards?&lt;br/&gt;No. That perk applies solely to -1 Attack Modifier cards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can I choose not to level up when I have the experience or not gain a perk when I have three check marks?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No. If you are in town and you have enough experience to level up, you are forced to do so, and must immediately gain all benefits from leveling up - this includes gaining a perk. [ERRATA] The rulebook should state &quot;MUST&quot; instead of &quot;CAN&quot; for the perk benefit.

			<body>The FAQ states:&lt;br/&gt;If a monster is revealed at the end of a round, does it take it's turn in the current round or the next round?&lt;br/&gt;The next round.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) &quot;it's&quot; should be &quot;its&quot; here.&lt;br/&gt;b) I don't think the answer is correct. When a monster is revealed at the end of a round by opening a door into a new room, the rule book is clear that all revealed monsters take their turn during the current round. It's even a bolded &quot;always&quot; in the rule book. I'm guessing that &quot;end of round&quot; means something different in this question. But as written I think the answer is incorrect.</body>

The entry is specifically about reveals at the &quot;end of a round&quot; from special scenario rules. I'll make that clearer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: The way you worded your question seems like you are placing the monsters at the end of the round and then playing their turn. That would be incorrect. They are placed immediately when the door opens and take their turns after the current character is done with his turn and based on their initiative order and the reveal rules. Also, note the difference between &quot;rounds&quot; and &quot;turns&quot;.</body>

			<body>Alex, can you weigh in on (or have Isaac weigh in on) the topic of this thread regarding triggering abilities or using items specifying &quot;Attack Action&quot; during granted out-of-turn abilities? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2163668/weapon-purity-commanding-presence-weapon-mass-dest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2163668/weapon-purity-comma...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on the wording in the FAQ as it stands, I think the rules would allow a situation where you could use an item, but not be able to apply its effects to anything, which doesn't seem right.</body>

			<body>FAQ Update&lt;br/&gt;-----------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following entry was specific to a class but it was better generalized since it applies to a couple of classes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an ability optionally grants an ally an action/ability (&quot;may move&quot;, &quot;may heal&quot;, etc.), who chooses if the ally performs the ability/action if it is granted to an NPC or summons?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If granted to an NPC, the caster choses whether the NPC will do the ability. If granted to a summons, the owner of the summons choses.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, I moved/copied various existing entries to a new section called Granting Abilities/Actions</body>

If your attack action is, say, &quot;Attack 3,&quot; then there is only one attack in your attack action. If it is &quot;Attack 2, Target 3,&quot; then your attack action consists of three separate attacks. If the action contains separate &quot;attack&quot; lines, all are part of the attack action. If the attack is an AoE, all attacks performed as part of the AoE are part of the attack action.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, I wanted to make sure that Long Spear, Battle Axe, and others like them were intended to apply to every attack within an action and that it wasn't meant to be &quot;ability&quot; rather than &quot;action&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interesting, those are more powerful than previously thought.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What exactly is considered a &lt;b&gt;single-target Attack Action&lt;/b&gt;?&lt;br/&gt;Any action in which only a single target could be attacked. This excludes actions with multiple separate attack abilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;so attack, move, attack is not a single target attack action&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But if your primary target for both attacks was the same?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry, I'm not trying to be deliberately obtuse, I want to be sure I fully grasp all permutations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;that still doesnt matter, as it can potentially target 2 enemies, it is not a single target attack action.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</body>

			<body>Hi Alex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another fun one for you. See the following thread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1456277/questions-battle-goals-streamliner-and-zealot&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1456277/questions-battle-go...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.. and scroll past the initial query.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Would be good to get clarification on this as even Isaac's own post in the thread is open to some ambiguity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cephalofair wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;At the end of a scenario, some of your cards will be in your hand, some will be in your discard pile and some will be in your lost pile. These goals ask you to count up the cards both in your discard and hand and then compare that total to the value on the goal.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Essentially, the question is: For the 'Streamliner' and 'Zealot' battle-goals, do non-loss cards in the active area at the end of a scenario count in the calculation of cards 'in hand and discard'?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook states that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;'Even though a bonus card is place in the active area, it is still considered discarded or lost.'&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For this reason, there is an argument that they should count for the purposes of the battle-goals within the 'discard' category.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The counter-argument has been that the battle-goal is intended to refer specifically to cards in the players hand and in the discard 'pile' so cards in the active area should not be counted.</body>

			<body>Probably best to take these comments to the relevant thread rather than clog the FAQ but in case it is helpful to clarify....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;horstderadler wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can always move a lost-card in its pile and a non-lost card in the discard-pile. So, the possible location of any cards (permanent, augment, summon, song) should be clear?!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's clear if a card is in the 'discard pile' or if a card is in the 'active area'. What is not clear is that, given that the FAQ states that non-loss cards in the active area can be considered discarded, do they count, along with those in the discard pile, when calculating the number of 'cards in hand and discard at the end of the scenario' for the purposes of the Zealot and Streamliner battle-goals?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OedipussyRex wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;When a scenario is over there are no active cards.

Nor do the cards.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This still raises the question of the status of active cards upon scenario-completion if, as you say, there are no active cards at the end of a scenario. Are you saying that the active area cards are null and void or that they would go into the respective discard or loss or be considered as such? The latter of these makes intuitive sense to me and could explain why Isaac didn't refer to the 'active area' in his quote. However, this is not specified in the rule-book and Marcel, who is seldom wrong on these things, has argued in the thread that non-loss cards in the active area, despite being considered discards as per. the FAQ, do not count as being a 'discard' for the purposes of these battle-goals.</body>

			<body>FAQ Update:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Added clarification to Active Area cards entry noting they are considered discarded/lost for the purpose of battle goals at the end of the scenario&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the designation of cards in my active area? Are they considered in my hand or in their own class or what?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Cards in your active area MAY be moved to the discard or lost pile (depending on their symbol or the symbol of the action which placed them there) at any time and in order to meet game requirements, so you can think of them as already discarded or lost. When you recover discard cards (by resting, for example) or lost cards (through special actions), you have the choice of picking up corresponding cards in your active area OR leaving them in play. Discardable cards in the active area may be lost to negate damage (technically moving them to the discard pile first). Cards in the active area are not considered to be in your hand. When evaluating battle goals at the end of a scenario, the cards are considered discarded or lost.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</body>

I've had a couple of crazy work weeks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, I'm considering slightly rewording the entry about when items can be used when doing stuff out of your turn (i.e you are granted actions or abilities).

			<body>Question about &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mindthief: Attack modifier card 110:&lt;br/&gt;TYPO - this card is missing a rolling modifier symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I have an R2 Kickstarter version and don't have this TYPO.  Should this be labelled as an R1 TYPO?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Same question about: &lt;br/&gt;Item 141 - [Errata] This item cannot be refreshed.</body>

			<body>As I read that, it means that I can't retroactively apply an item to the attack that I'm doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Like, I draw the item refresh modifier, I can't say &quot;Oh, I use my poison dagger to add poison to this attack&quot; and immediately refresh it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anything that applies to this attack had to have been used already before the modifier draw. </body>

It refers to this passage in the Rule book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characters can use items at any time, within the constraints of what is written on the item card, including in the middle of a card ability. However, if an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage, or disadvantage), it has to be used before an attack modifier is drawn. [...]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intent is that you can refresh an item that was played during the attack. However, if that item affects the attack, you can't reuse it because the modifier has already been drawn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are you saying that there was a previous ruling that says you can refresh a power potion and use it after an attack modifier was drawn?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SevenSpirits wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;The question that needed answering IMO was whether you can use an item after seeing the modifier draw but before applying the modifier draw's special ability. I'm confused by the Q + A provided.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regarding the timing, since it has been ruled that items can be used in the middle of an action (even within a move or an attack), then you can draw the modifier card, use an item, then refresh it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: In order to avoid confusion, I can reword the entry to this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If a modifier card allows you to refresh an item, can you refresh an item that is used in the middle of the attack or must the item have been used before the attack began?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can refresh an item that was/will be used during of the attack. Note that the rule that you can't use an item that affects an attack AFTER the modifier card is drawn still applies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>question on the wording of a FAQ entry for Saw Class&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Medical Pack and Large Medical Pack:&lt;br/&gt;These cards have an X (R1) / M (R2+) on them, but they are not cards that are included in the Sawbones' normal hand. Instead, keep the stack of them off to the side and hand them out to other characters when an ability tells you to. &lt;b&gt;When these cards are lost&lt;/b&gt;, or the scenario ends, return them to the Sawbones' supply.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I believe that should say &quot;When these cards are discarded&quot; instead, as that is what it states on the cards themselves.&lt;br/&gt;If I interpret the mechanics right, these cards can never be &quot;lost&quot; and never actually sit in any discard pile.  The Sawbones gives one of them to an ally via one of his abilities, and it stays in that ally's hand until it is played (or discarded for some other reason, or at the end of the scenario or if that character exhausts), but then is immediately returned to the Sawbones' supply.[/o]</body>

			<body>In the enhancement section, you may want to clarify that an enhancement's cost continues to increase based on how many enhancements are on the same action.  The chart in the book just says &quot;previous enhancements&quot; instead of &quot;previous enhancements to action&quot;, and has confused me every time I go back and look at it (so far).  I know the rulebook specifies &quot;action&quot; in the enhancement rules, but I also thought &quot;action&quot; was the same as &quot;card&quot; until I read some other threads here.  Just a suggestion.</body>

			<body>I checked the rule book and the FAQ, and neither really speak to this. It relates to the rule: &quot;Each time an individual player retires a character, that player also gains one extra perk to apply to all future characters they create.&quot;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;1) So, if my last character had one perk, do I check off 2 perks worth of check boxes, or does the new character just come with the 2 perks (with no checked boxes), plus a potential for 6 more perks?&lt;br/&gt;2) If the character had a check or 2 towards the next perk when the character retires, do the unallocated checks get carried to the new character?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks!</body>

The only question to ask is how many characters you've retired before creating this new character. Your new character starts with that many perks, plus any for starting above level 1.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 18 check boxes remain empty, to be filled during gameplay (meaning your second character could actually get all their perks if they take long enough to retire).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rulebook is pretty clear on this - you're creating a new character, with no hint that anything carries over, and you're getting extra perks not getting sufficient checks to grant extra perks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: also, please ask rules questions in a new thread - only use this thread to suggest additions to the FAQ, ideally with a source for an official answer.</body>

			<body>&quot;Per the rules, obstacles cannot be created/placed such that they block off an area of the map. How does this work with doors that may be opened or closed in a future turn?&lt;br/&gt;Consider only the current state of doors when determining if an area will be blocked off by the obstacle.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This answer is too terse/vague. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reading other things that Isaac has written, I believe the intention is that you should never block off an area of the map when you create an obstacle, not even through closed doors. As-written, the FAQ answer could be misinterpreted as meaning that it's fine to block any closed door, basically treating it like a wall. However, this answer really just addresses the edge case where there are 2 doors leading to the same part of the map, and a player is attempting to block one of them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A) If both doors are open, then you can block one of them&lt;br/&gt;B) If one of the doors is open, then you can block the closed door&lt;br/&gt;C) If both doors are closed, then you can't block either of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rewording the answer I think could help clarify things, something like:&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Check whether part of the map is being blocked off by the placement of the new obstacle. When considering doors on the map, consider all doors that are currently closed to be walls except for the door adjacent to the new obstacle; consider that door as though it were open&quot;</body>

By the quoted FAQ ruling, which treats the closed door as not being a valid route, that would appear to be legal. By previous comments from Isaac, that would appear to be illegal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I haven't checked to see whether the FAQ provides any further context that would change the FAQ's position on that action.</body>

			<body>Although I would welcome a different ruling, the current one comes from &lt;a  href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1936029/placing-obstacles-cutting-sections-map-and-doors&quot;   &gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, where he didn't answer the most salient question but did clearly lay down the principles he was using to answer some other scenarios:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Closed doors are considered walls.&lt;br/&gt;2. Only consider the current state of the board.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on those, it &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; legal to wall off a closed door, since that door is treated exactly the same as a wall hex for determining legal obstacle placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>The FAQ says:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Item 013&lt;br/&gt;[Errata] Minor Stamina Potion - The item should allow you to recover only one discarded card. This is a change from the expansion that applies to the base game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's no such change in Forgotten Circles, which is, as of now, &quot;the expansion&quot;. More importantly, the way it is currently written tells those people who think &quot;The FAQ is the rules&quot; should make this &quot;errata&quot; change immediately. Your last post about this said you were going to make it clear the change is currently optional. </body>

			<body>Here's a clarification request, here's the entry on element consumption:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If an element consumption is attached to an attack, when can I chose to consume the element?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before the attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What about an attack action with multiple attacks? If an ability that provides multiple attacks allows the consumption of an element to augment the entire attack action, can the player begin making attacks without consuming an element and then decide to consume an element to effect the remainder of attacks? If yes, then that would be consistent with the ruling for movement: the player can take some of the movement and then consume an element to augment the remainder of the movement. But the answer could be reworded to provide clarification</body>

How does this work with doors that may be opened or closed in a future turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obstacles cannot block any current or future section of the map. Players need to evaluate the current state of the board as well as if all doors are open and the placement of the obstacle must be legal in both cases&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last question regarding element consumption and multi-attack abilities is pending a response from Isaac.</body>

			<body>Excuse me if this rule point has already been discussed but I didn't find any clear view in the FAQ and 40 pages of discussion are too much for me to read &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/biggrin.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the advantage subject, if I understand well you draw two cards and take the best of them and if one of them is a combo then you add the two cards together. But what if the first card is a null action ?&lt;br/&gt;Idem if you draw 2 combo cards : the rules precise that you have to draw an extra card as long as no combo card are drawn. So what's happened if the last card is a null ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In those two cases, it results in a null action (maybe with other benefit like element infusion or push or something else) and for an advantage it sucks a little no ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So am I correct or is there something I have missed ?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thank you for your answer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lord Bouba</body>

			<body>yes if you draw a null and only rolling ones, you make zero damage.&lt;br/&gt;but this is the same for disadvantage, where you can draw a *2 and only rolling and get the *2 (but no rolling)</body>

Can I use it in the middle of a movement or other ability? Can I use items outside of my turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Items are only used during your turn unless it is used as a reaction to an enemy  (as per its wording) or during a granted out-of-turn ability if the ability matches the item's restrictions. Note that wording like &quot;add +X to the entire attack action&quot; on an item expands the item's scope - it isn't a restriction that the item can only be used during full actions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During your turn you can use an item at any time, including but not limited to: during a movement, after consuming an element and gaining its effects during attack resolution, or after you have taken all your actions - with the following restrictions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;Must meet all restrictions listed on the card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;If an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage or disadvantage), it has to be used before an attack modifier is drawn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;If an item grants an action, it cannot be used in the middle of another action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;An item cannot be used before/during &quot;start of turn&quot; effects nor after/during &quot;end of turn&quot; effects&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is there any limitation to the number of items I can use on my turn or even during the same ability?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In all of the threads I've found discussing this issue, it has remained unresolved, with the point of contention being how to interpret the highlighted portion below:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;aflorin wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;During your turn you can use an item at any time, including but not limited to: during a movement, after consuming an element and gaining its effects during attack resolution, or after you have taken all your actions - with the following restrictions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;Must meet all restrictions listed on the card&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00]If an item affects an attack (e.g. adds a bonus, an effect, advantage or disadvantage), it has to be used before an attack modifier is drawn[/BGCOLOR]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;If an item grants an action, it cannot be used in the middle of another action&lt;br/&gt;&lt;pre&gt;  - &lt;/pre&gt;An item cannot be used before/during &quot;start of turn&quot; effects nor after/during &quot;end of turn&quot; effects&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One side will claim that for a multi-target attack, the above rule refers to the entire attack action, and thus you cannot use a power potion after any modifier cards for &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of the targets have been drawn. The other side will say that the phrase &quot;an attack&quot; here refers to each individual attack within the attack action, so as long as you are not applying the bonus to any targets for which you've already drawn modifier cards, you can still use a power potion and apply the bonus to the remaining targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, it seems like this part might be applicable here, but I'm not sure exactly what it means or if it applies to this situation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;aflorin wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note that wording like &quot;add +X to the entire attack action&quot; on an item expands the item's scope - it isn't a restriction that the item can only be used during full actions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does &quot;full actions&quot; here mean the entire attack action, therefore implying that such an item can be used for part of an AoE attack?</body>

			<body>I have question on Advantage/Disadvantage ambiguity. I checked the examples and could not find the situation we were in. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is this ambiguous (we can choose any time what we want) or is one better then the other (we need to choose that option any time it happens).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mindtheif drawing +2 vs +1+draw again&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some situations we think that +2 is better if we get sure kill to avoid drawing miss or some -1 with the +1+draw. But in some situations having option to go for +1 and getting more dmg can help. What do you say guys. Ambiguous or not? </body>

			<body>Hi I question about this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is the designation of cards in my active area? Are they considered in my hand or in their own class or what?&lt;br/&gt;Cards in your active area MAY be moved to the discard or lost pile (depending on their symbol or the symbol of the action which placed them there) at any time and in order to meet game requirements, so you can think of them as already discarded or lost. &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;When you recover discard cards (by resting, for example) or lost cards (through special actions), you have the choice of picking up corresponding cards in your active area OR leaving them in play.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Discardable cards in the active area may be lost to negate damage (technically moving them to the discard pile first). Cards in the active area are not considered to be in your hand. When evaluating battle goals at the end of a scenario, the cards are considered discarded or lost&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the bold Statement, it says that you can do that with your active cards, does summon criatures count for this, for example if i use a power to recover lost cards could i use it to recover a summon in play.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks!</body>

I only mention this because there was a recent conversation about how summon item cards should also be placed in your active area. This is because if you want to recover that consumed item card, it must go back to your normal item area (and therefore remove the summon from the board) before it [the summon item card] can be used again.</body>

In either case (whether it is an item summon or an ability summon), the summoned ally is removed from the board when their summon card (ability or item) is moved out of the active area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obviously you can't recover a consumed item with a card that recovers lost cards, nor vice versa, because they are two different things.  But the treatment of the summoned ally is the same either way.</body>

			<body>Thanks for doing this faq, just one question. When retiring a character and starting a new one do I have to reset my attack modifier deck? I understand that if I’m creating a new character and the prosperity is 3 I will be starting a level 3 character and get 3 perks plus the 1 bonus one for having retired my first character? Is that bit correct? Do I reset my attack deck too when I start the new character or do I get to keep my already modified attack deck? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks</body>

I understand that if I’m creating a new character and the prosperity is 3 I will be starting a level 3 character and get 3 perks plus the 1 bonus one for having retired my first character? Is that bit correct? Do I reset my attack deck too when I start the new character or do I get to keep my already modified attack deck? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;you only get 2 perks (as level 1 doesn’t give you one) plus any from retired chars. &lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>Thanks for putting this together.  One quick suggestion - I think it would be good to change the wording of this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;When something that summons monsters dies, do the monsters it summoned die too?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do summons die after their summoners die?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Summons of &lt;i&gt;monsters&lt;/i&gt; stay alive, but summons of &lt;i&gt;player characters&lt;/i&gt; will die (when the player becomes exhausted).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's technically OK the way it is because it's under the &quot;Monster Summon&quot; heading, but not too much of a stretch for a new player to think that the Mindthief is a &quot;monster summoner&quot; (the RAW could afford to be a bit more pedantic here).</body>

			<body>Can we get the entry for a lightning bolt class ability card expanded?

			<body>I have a little mix of suggested clarifications and nitpicks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;You may not skip the following abilities/effects:&lt;br/&gt;[..]&lt;br/&gt;  * Stand alone infusions (i.e. not attached to a specific ability). [..] Also, for characters, at least one ability on the action must be performed in order to gain the standalone Infusion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitpick: this can read a little awkwardly since &quot;skip&quot; can be read to mean &quot;end up not performing&quot; as well as the intended &quot;choose not to perform&quot;. Another way to write the last part to remove the hint of a contradiction might be: &quot;&lt;u&gt;Note however&lt;/u&gt;, for characters, at least one ability on the action must be performed in order to gain the standalone Infusion &lt;u&gt;in the first place&lt;/u&gt;.&quot; The &quot;in the first place&quot; qualifier could possibly also be appended to the corresponding statement on XP directly below, although I didn't read that to be as potentially confusing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;You may skip any other ability or effect, including some or all effects attached to an attack but you must chose to do so BEFORE drawing an attack modifier card.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is not strictly true since modifier cards may attach effects to an attack which can then be skipped, an example of which was just given in the list. This is presented better in the &quot;Player Abilities&quot; section where it goes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;You must choose whether you will do an effect to an attack before you draw a modifier card. Some modifier cards have their own attack effects and you can choose to apply them after you draw if they qualify as optional effects.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Per the rules, obstacles cannot be created/placed such that they block off an area of the map. How does this work with doors that may be opened or closed in a future turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Obstacles cannot block any current or future section of the map.

What could possibly complicate this is hypothetical scenarios with circular paths where doors can both open and close, but the above answer doesn't address the &quot;closed&quot; part of the question anyway.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are character summons affected by the ignore scenario effects perk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doesn't seem to be strictly true, since summons use the character's combat deck and are therefore at least indirectly affected by (the lack of) modifier cards added to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Does consuming items during a road event make them unavailable during the scenario?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does “unavailable” mean regarding items consumed during road events?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You must equip the item into a slot, already consumed, but mechanics that allow you to refresh items can apply to the unavailable item&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two things here. First, unless the introduction and subsequent explanation of the term &quot;unavailable&quot; (which is not in the rules or on the cards that I can see) are included only out of a strict ambition to represent questions as asked, however convoluted, it should be removed in favour of a single question: &quot;What does it mean to consume an item during road events?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, if the answer really means to say you &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; equip such a consumed item - and I would be interested in knowing if this is a clarification of intent from the designer or somehow derived from the rules - then the term should definitely be exchanged for another in the answer if not in the question, since an item coming along with you mandatorily would seem to be the &lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt; of it being unavailable - it's &lt;i&gt;over&lt;/i&gt;-available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suggestion for an addition to the &quot;Components and Icons&quot; section: Included enhancement stickers are not meant to place a limit on enhancements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minor suggestion for a scenario 15 note: The layout calls for 2 &quot;d&quot; markers to be used, but there is only one included in the game, so use another marker or a cat or something.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, thanks for a good job in general.</body>

Opening the door in the future would cause it to stop being a wall, which would result in a blocked off section of the map, so you can't put obstacles there. Make sense?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do you have a suggestion for how to make it clearer?</body>

There's a rule treating &lt;i&gt;locked&lt;/i&gt; doors as walls, and closed doors are treated as walls for the purpose of monster movement, but not for player movement. Since the obstacle rule exists pretty much to facilitate monster movement I admit that's relevant, but at the very least I can imagine some would come to the FAQ thinking of closed doors as Stuff What Must Be Reachable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SevenSpirits wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a suggestion for how to make it clearer?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think the problem now is mainly with the second sentence. The first sentence is technically correct (if I'm right about the intent) but quite dense; the second tries to clarify it but is contradictory/incomplete, saying there are two cases when this does not follow generally from the first sentence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(As an example of where the method offered by the second sentence fails, consider four rooms in a ring connected by doors. If the door from the starting room to one adjacent room is blocked off, this doesn't violate the rule for the current board (under the closed-doors-as-walls interpretation, nothing has been blocked off) or the all-doors-open board (everything is connected in a horseshoe). But if you then open the blocked-off door, which isn't prohibited by any rule, you now have an obstacle situation the rule is meant to stop.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't know how convoluted the scenarios in the book actually get, but maybe something like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The intent of the rule is that no situation should arise where any section of connected hexes bounded by walls and closed doors has been completely separated by obstacles into multiple parts of at least one hex each. Therefore you need to evaluate the current state of the board as well as any possible future combinations of open and closed doors. In the majority of scenarios with linear layouts and doors that do not close once opened, this just means you cannot make a barrier of obstacles connecting two walls with at least one non-wall hex to either side. In a scenario with circular connections between rooms and/or closing doors, you may need to consider additional possible cases where a barrier does not separate an area at the time of formation but could potentially end up doing so if additional spaces are opened or connecting passages are closed off.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This a) states the principle behind the rule, b) outlines the general method for implementing it, c) provides a simple(ish) rule for the common case, and d) includes a reminder to watch out for non-common cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SevenSpirits wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font color=&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotetitle'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;squegeeboo wrote:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;So if you surround an obstacle with more obstacles, you're potentially blocking off that future open area.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That's allowed though.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So are you allowed to make, say, four obstacles in a diamond shape in the corner of a hexagonal room? I would have assumed that isn't legal, since a non-wall, non-closed door hex has been blocked off.</body>

One of those abilities will create the persistent bonue. If you choose to perform that ability, the card will go into your Active Area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So long as that card remains in your Active Area, the specific persistent bonus will remain active. Any other abilities on the card only take effect while resolving that card's action, not when or if the persistent bonus triggers later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example, the Mindthief has multiple &quot;Augment&quot; actions that have an ability that creates a persistent bonus (until you play another Augment ability) that triggers on melee attacks followed by a normal attack ability and an XP ability. When you play the action, you place the card into your active area (discarding any existing Augment), then perform the attack ability (triggering the persistent bonus), then gain the XP. On a later melee attack, you only get the persistent bonus effect from the augment ability, not the additional attack, nor the XP.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not sold on including the example - it helps make things clearer, but also bloats the FAQ.</body>

Replacing 2 lines with 10 lines is not ideal though i dont think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could i suggest a simpler approach might be to focus on the availability of the door tile. Something along the lines of, &quot;doors are not considered as walls for the purposes of placing obstacles.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think this satisfisfies the conditions youre worried about. Its pretty intuitive.&lt;br/&gt;Like you said, doors are &quot;stuff what must be reachable.&quot;</body>

The first sentence is technically correct (if I'm right about the intent) but quite dense; the second tries to clarify it but is contradictory/incomplete, saying there are two cases when this does not follow generally from the first sentence.&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;I don't know how convoluted the scenarios in the book actually get, but maybe something like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The intent of the rule is that no situation should arise where any section of connected hexes bounded by walls and closed doors has been completely separated by obstacles into multiple parts of at least one hex each. Therefore you need to evaluate the current state of the board as well as any possible future combinations of open and closed doors. In the majority of scenarios with linear layouts and doors that do not close once opened, this just means you cannot make a barrier of obstacles connecting two walls with at least one non-wall hex to either side. In a scenario with circular connections between rooms and/or closing doors, you may need to consider additional possible cases where a barrier does not separate an area at the time of formation but could potentially end up doing so if additional spaces are opened or connecting passages are closed off&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I agree some clarity is good. I feel the current reading of the FAQ is the best weve had for a while. Replacing 2 lines with 10 lines is not ideal though i dont think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could i suggest a simpler approach might be to focus on the availability of the door tile. Something along the lines of, &quot;doors are not considered as walls for the purposes of placing obstacles.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think this satisfisfies the conditions youre worried about. Its pretty intuitive.&lt;br/&gt;Like you said, doors are &quot;stuff what must be reachable.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal appears to be that at any time during the game, you could pick any two hexes, and, ignoring any obstacles on the hexes themselves, if there's a path between them that a flying enemy could follow, then there's also a path that a non-flying enemy could follow provided any figures in the way were removed. And that this is guaranteed to stay true, no matter what order doors are opened (and closed if that's an option).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There probably needs to be an exception for any scenario setups where part of the map is actually blocked by scenario obstacles (I'm not aware of any examples from the base game, but there's at least one solo scenario where a room is divided into two by obstacles).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Doors don't count as walls&quot; doesn't work because they do count when there's a circular path through multiple doors - you can't block any of the doorways while another door in the loop is closed, or is open but might be closed again later.</body>

This means for instance you cannot separate two spaces connected by an alternate route if there is a possibility that route could close, and you cannot block off a door if there is not an alternate route to that door guaranteed to remain open.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first sentence technically answers the question and the second provides a couple of examples. The tradeoff is that it provides no underlying principle and assumes the reader is clear on the obstacle rule except concerning doors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: Add in weird scenario-based exception, of course.</body>

But i think youre right, and i realise my suggestion actually constitutes a rules change. So probably best to disreguard it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I think kaffedrakes above suggestion is a very good one. It does assume the player understands obstacles. But this is only meant to clarify. Not give full explanations for why or examples. And this does clarify something otherwise not stated in the rulebook.</body>

			<body>Possible follow-up question:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strike&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;What about scenarios where parts of the map are blocked off from the start or become blocked off during play due to scenario instructions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;u&gt;Presumably you can&lt;/u&gt; disregard currently blocked-off hexes only for the purposes of this rule.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Omit the underlined if you're confident we're not just making up a rule here and/or there's no other way it could possibly work. It might seem excessive to add something like, &quot;You are not obligated to unblock them when possible.&quot;&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, wait, that's not great. Maybe:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;What about scenarios where parts of the map are blocked off from the start or become blocked off during play due to scenario instructions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treat each isolated section of the map separately for the purposes of this rule.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Basically: existing divisions aren't your fault, but you can't make subdivisions.</body>

			<body>I think the main point of a clarification on this matter would be that existing blockages don't shut down placement of obstacles anywhere until they've been undone, which would technically follow if the formal verification process is seen as something like, &quot;After you place your obstacle, is any part of the map blocked off? Then you cannot place your obstacle.&quot;</body>

If 52 were remade post-Forgotten Circles, the obstacles would be walls (possibly with a new interaction added with the Diviner and any other Teleport abilities), and 73 has special rules for its obstacles, so both of them are very special cases.[/o]</body>

			<body>The obstacle discussion should be in another thread at this point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As for the Active Area abilities entry, how does this sound:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When are abilities from Active Bonus cards resolved?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active bonus abililties (like shield, retaliate, +X Attack, abilities from consumed charges on the card, etc.) are resolved when the card is played and while the card is in the active area - and only if the requirements for the ability/effect are met. Other abilities listed on the card that aren't active bonus abilities are resolved only when the card is played. For example, Mindthief's Feedback Loop grants a Shield, an Attack 1 and XP when played. However, only the shield can be triggered again while the card is in the active area.</body>

My understanding is that you can play Feedback Loop without a melee target, in which case you can set up the Augment and gain the XP, but not get the Shield (because you didn't make a melee attack to trigger the Augment).</body>

			<body>The official 2nd printing changelog (&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1761512/official-second-printing-change-log&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1761512/official-second-pri...&lt;/a&gt;) states that personal quest 514 reduced the number of exhaustions from 15 to 12. However, the second printing still shows 15 exhaustions on this card. Is the 2nd printing changelog incorrect (and this card wasn't supposed to change after all), or should there be an R2 errata in this FAQ to reduce PQ 514 from 15 to 12, as originally intended?</body>

			<body>FAQ Update&lt;br/&gt;-----------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When are abilities from Active Bonus cards granted?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active bonus abililties (like shield, retaliate, +X Attack, abilities from consumed charges on the card, etc.) are granted when the card is played and while the card is in the active area - and only if the requirements for the ability/effect are met. Other abilities listed on the card that aren't active bonus abilities are granted when the card is played. For example, Mindthief's Feedback Loop grants an Attack 1, Shield (if the Attack is made) and XP when played. However, only the shield can be triggered again (when an attack is made) while the card is in the active area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;When a monster has a non-attack ability that doesn't define a specific target (like &quot;Muddle - Target one adjacent enemy&quot;), who does it target?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Normal focusing rules are used to determine the target&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you gain Add Target for a single target attack that grants XP if the target meets a specific criteria (example: Scoundre's Single Out), do you gain the XP for the new additional target if it meets the criteria?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Clarified one condition when items can't be used in the Item Use section:&lt;br/&gt;An item cannot be used before/during &quot;start of turn&quot; effects nor after/during &quot;end of turn&quot; effects. Note that if an item grants an extra action at the end of your turn, that effectively extends the turn so items can be used during that extra action.</body>

My guess it would apply to other things as well. From yesterday: &quot;Move +x, Muddle, target one adjacent enemy.&quot; The move will always be performed as-if the monster had a melee attack, then according to another recent ruling the Muddle ability would assign Muddled to the focus(if possible), otherwise to a different adjacent enemy (if possible).&lt;br/&gt;</body>

			<body>[user=aflorin]Alex[/user], I just noticed an FAQ entry that could use some revision, IMO.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;Monster Turns&quot; section; &quot;Monster - Attacks&quot; subsection: &lt;font color=#6F4C0C&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you clarify how monsters do attacks against multiple targets?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Area of Effect, Add Target and Target X attacks are treated exactly like they are for players. Unless otherwise stated by a card, the multiple attacks cannot be done on the same enemy because they all come from the same ability. If a card says that multiple attacks CAN be done on the same enemy (as an exception to the rule), the monster will attack its focus until it's dead/exhausted, &lt;u&gt;after which it will follow the focus rules to find its next target.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has since been ruled that in cases where the monster ability card states &quot;Target one enemy with all attacks&quot; that the monster will &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; find another target after its initial target dies/exhausts.  Thus I believe this part of the entry (that I underlined) could be deleted, or changed to reflect the updated ruling.</body>

Unless otherwise stated by a card, the multiple attacks cannot be done on the same enemy because they all come from the same ability. If a card says that multiple attacks CAN be done on the same enemy (as an exception to the rule), the monster will attack its focus until it's dead/exhausted, &lt;u&gt;after which it will follow the focus rules to find its next target.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It has since been ruled that in cases where the monster ability card states &quot;Target one enemy with all attacks&quot; that the monster will &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; find another target after its initial target dies/exhausts.  Thus I believe this part of the entry (that I underlined) could be deleted, or changed to reflect the updated ruling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yep, you are correct. There was a bit of back and forth on that back then until Isaac settled on honoring the card's wording &quot;Target ONE enemy&quot;. I'll change the entry.</body>

			<body>Regarding action cards that are placed in allies' Active Area:&lt;br/&gt;The FAQ should mention (for example under &quot;Active Area&quot;) that only characters have an Active Area, and that such cards can only be played on characters and not on monster allies, NPCs or character summons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This could also be mentioned for some character classes.

			<body>The FAQ did not answer my question regarding Ranged attacks. Not sure if it’s just me or I would think many players have this question. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Say an Archer is adjacent to a Brute, but a couple squares away from the Mindthief. Let’s also say the Archer can’t move. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Does the Archer automatically focus on the Brute as the nearest enemy, or the Mindthief as the character who is ready for a Ranged attack. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Archer can shoot the Mindthief, does it suffer from Disadvantage because it is next to the Brute?&lt;br/&gt;This would answer my question if the roles were reversed as a player could of course have free choice of its focus. </body>

			<body>Another thread had me looking at the rulebook and I noticed it doesn't seem to have a specific term for what the FAQ calls &quot;infusions&quot;. Instead it uses the word &quot;infusion&quot; to refer to the state of having an element active, and just loosely uses &quot;affinity&quot; and &quot;element icon&quot; to refer to the card symbols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I wouldn't go so far as to say this is making people think infusion happens during a turn (when processing the &quot;infusions&quot;), but there is at least some potential for confusion.</body>

			<body>Not sure if this is something that needs to be noted, but the game is slightly inconsistent with the term &quot;target&quot;. Per page 21 of the rulebook beneficial abilities do not target, so they do not have targets; the word &quot;never&quot; is used in bold for ultra super emphasis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Page 46 however says that strengthen and bless enhancements apply conditions to &quot;all targets of the ability&quot;, copied from the harmful enhancements entry. Technically the term &quot;recipients&quot; should be used instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further down, the rule &quot;Double the base cost of an enhancement (other than an attack hex) if it is applied to an ability that targets multiple figures&quot; technically does not double the cost for an ability that reads for instance &quot;Affect all adjacent allies&quot;, and should presumably read &quot;that targets or affects multiple figures&quot;. A note on page 47 similarly reads &quot;Double base cost for any ability with multiple targets.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And then there are card abilities with multi-targeting Heal that explicitly use the word &quot;Target&quot; in addition to the target symbol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strike&gt;An FAQ entry could read for instance:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Page 46 says that the base cost of an enhancement is doubled for an ability that targets multiple figures. Does this mean you don't double the cost for positive abilities with multiple recipients, since they do not target?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No, read that as &quot;affects or targets multiple figures&quot;.&lt;/strike&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: Never mind, I found the corresponding entry using different search terms when searching for something else. :&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;P</body>

Sometimes the scenario says that an allied monster uses a player deck. Now suppose that ally had a summon. What deck would the summon use?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The monster deck. It is still a monster summoning another monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Edit: I did just change the entry to &quot;The monster's deck unless otherwise specified by the scenario&quot;</body>

			<body>Ah I see. So summons always use the summoner's deck, except when the scenario rules change the summoner's deck. They use the deck that the summoner &lt;i&gt;would &lt;/i&gt;be using if there weren't any scenario rules? Seems like an unnecessary exception to me.</body>

			<body>Are there even any situations where there are monster allies (allied with the player characters, that is) that do any summoning?&lt;br/&gt;As far as I know, once a monster is summoned, it acts exactly like any non-summoned monster of its type, with the only exceptions being that it doesn't get a turn during the round in which it was summoned and it doesn't drop a money token when it is killed.  So there is really no need to differentiate which attack modifier deck it uses, as it uses the same attack modifier deck that any other monster of that group would use.</body>

			<body>A hypothetical scenario goes like this: Someone takes a &quot;Move 3, Attack 3&quot; action with no enemy in range and has an item they want to use that reads, &quot;During your single-target melee attack action...&quot; They look up the definition of &quot;single-target attack action&quot; in the FAQ finding that yes, the current situation meets the definition as written there. So they use the item and fulfil their battle goal. But this is presumably illegal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm not really weighing the likelihood that this will ever happen, I just believe it would be strictly more clear and accurate to add that one word. I don't think it's a &quot;stretch&quot; that an entry reading &quot;What &lt;b&gt;exactly&lt;/b&gt; is considered a single-target Attack Action?&quot; should contain the full and exact definition one needs to see when looking that up. But if you don't agree, it's fine and I won't bring it up again.</body>

			<body>In order for an attack action to be considered as such, you have to do an attack. There is FAQ entry stating that. Are there even any items that are for single target attack actions that make any sense to use when you aren't doing an actual attack?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'll add the word but honestly it is a nitpick. As you said, it has &quot;negligible confusion potential&quot;, the operative word being negligible. I'm all for making changes for clarity's sake and to avoid confusion and contradictions but I rather not chase down wording just to make them perfect when the change doesn't really add anything. We could spend hours doing that.</body>

			<body>I can't find this - My Battle Goal as the [o]Vermiling Mindthief[/o] was to [o] Open a Door to a new tile [/o] but my summons went before me and the only open space for it to move to to attack a monster (due to traps being dropped by monsters) was ON the door.  So We played it that the door opened immediately AND i got credit.  Was this correct?  Do summons even Open doors?  Since summons DO give you Kill credit, do they give you open door credit/set off trap/ anything else you might need to do to get credit?&lt;br/&gt;</body>

There is FAQ entry stating that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Speaking generally on this point, I think it's worth considering that FAQs like this are as often as not consumed in bite-sized pieces. So while &quot;the complete rule for this is given in another section focusing on the same topic&quot; or &quot;you'll get the context for understanding this entry if you also read this other entry over here&quot; can be sufficient reasons not to flesh out some specific entry, they aren't necessarily.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few more things which hopefully aren't edging into hours-on-nitpicks territory:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. There's a typo in the scenario 85 note: &quot;[o]sum demons[/o]&quot;. [o]Sure, math is evil, but.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. A prospective note for the Three Spears class:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Level 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[o]&lt;b&gt;Continual Supply (card 219):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you lose the card to the top action, it still cannot be recovered.[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rationale: This is the only double-loss card I've seen so far that doesn't have the &quot;cannot recover&quot; icon on both halves, so it seems like a card design error to me. A little less important if there are several more cards looking like this, but I wouldn't rule out that someone might look at the card and think the missing icon is significant and the card &quot;remembers&quot; how it was lost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. About the previous addition of a scenario note for 15 (which incidentally has an extra S and is missing a period):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#6F4C0C&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;The setup calls for 2 &quot;d&quot; markers but there is only one in the games Use another marker as an alternative.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When I submitted this it was the first scenario we encountered where the tokens didn't cover the icons in the scenario book. I have since learned that a) the tokens were added in the second printing, so the scenario book wasn't written with a specific set of tokens in mind, and b) there are several other scenarios where all icons cannot be placed assuming you ever wanted to. Knowing this my suggestion would have been different, so I propose any one of the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;a) Remove the scenario note for 15, and add a new entry under the &quot;Components and Icons&quot; heading along these lines:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#6F4C0C&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;There aren't enough scenario aid tokens to cover all the icons used in some scenarios, what's up with that?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The set of scenario aid tokens is not strictly meant to cover all the icons in every scenario. If necessary, use other markers as an alternative.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;b) Keep the scenario note for 15, appending something along these lines:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;font color=#6F4C0C&gt;&lt;div class='quote'&gt;&lt;div class='quotebody'&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note that there are other scenarios for which something similar is the case.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;c) Keep it as it is now (except edit the typo).</body>

This is denoted by the [non-recoverable] symbol. &lt;b&gt;This symbol applies to the card no matter how the card was lost.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, maybe they should have included the non-recoverable symbol for the top loss action too, but that would be redundant, and it still wouldn't cover the possible case of that card being lost during a rest or to negate damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The simple fact is that if a card with the non-recoverable symbol anywhere on it ends up in the lost pile, it can't be recovered during the scenario, regardless of how it was lost.</body>

			<body>FAQ Update &lt;br/&gt;-------&lt;br/&gt;Replaced the entry regarding obstacle placement in front of closed doors with the following for clarification and to cover other cases:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Per the rules, obstacles cannot be placed if they block off an area of the map. How does this work with doors that may be opened in a future turn?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You may not block off a closed door unless there is an open path to the other side of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about scenarios where parts of the map are blocked off from the start or become blocked off during play due to scenario instructions?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treat each isolated section of the map separately for the purposes of this rule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you allowed to create obstacles next to an area consisting only of obstacles (ex: several obstacles up against a wall)?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, as long as you don't block off an open area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can you destroy or move an obstacle inside a group of existing obstacles if it creates a blocked-off area?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;No</body>

			<body>I've seen a lengthy discussion elsewhere, but I still don't understand how the rules work regarding classification of an attack as ranged or melee. Consider the following three cards:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cranium Overload (Mindthief)&lt;/u&gt;: the fact that the killed enemy is chosen at range 4 apparently makes the attacks that follow ranged attacks, even though the formatting appears to be a melee attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rocky End (Cragheart)&lt;/u&gt;: the fact that the obstacles destroyed are within range 2 &lt;i&gt;doesn't&lt;/i&gt; make the attack that follows a ranged attack. Apart from nebulous flavor-based reasons, the only clear difference I can see from the formatting is that Cranium Overload tells you to target enemies surrounding the killed enemy, while Rocky End has no targeting instructions. I understand why that makes Rocky End a melee attack by default, but I'm not sure &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; this makes Cranium Overload ranged. Presumably the rule would have to be &quot;if an attack specifies targets that could be non-adjacent to the attacker, the attack is ranged.&quot; But that runs up against...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;u&gt;Explosive Punch (Cragheart)&lt;/u&gt;: this attack specifies targets that could be non-adjacent to the attacker, and yet the attack is melee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is there a consistent logic to these interpretations? I can't see it.</body>

Additionally, it should be noted that if the card has a spent icon in the lower right corner, it is not technically spent until all charges have been lost, and so cannot be refreshed through resting or other abilities until all charges have been used.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's not an item with charges, and it's not a passive effect (like Iron Helmet) so its use is optional.</body>

Effects dependant on the push/pull (like Cragheart's Heaving Swing), apply to all pushes caused by the attack, including pushes/pulls from Attack Modifier cards or Items.</body>

			<body>I suggest you clarify the interaction of these two parts of the FAQ:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[heading]How do I track lost prosperity?[/heading]&lt;br/&gt;Note it next to the prosperity track and then scratch out the note the next time you gain prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[heading]If I lose a check mark, can that make me lose a perk?[/heading]&lt;br/&gt;No. You cannot go below the threshold of a perk, experience level, or prosperity level when losing check marks, experience, or prosperity, respectively. So if you have three check marks (enough to gain a perk), and then lose a check mark, nothing happens. You don't lose a perk, and &lt;b&gt;you don't go into check mark debt&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I'm confused about the term &quot;check mark debt.&quot;  I assumed it mean you don't actually lose a check mark in this case (e.g., the case where you have exactly three check marks and are required to lose one).  But now, based on the prosperity answer, I think the &quot;nothing happens&quot; is not completely accurate.  Maybe it was just me, but I interpreted that as &quot;if you have three check marks and lose one, you don't actually lose one.&quot;  I think you're saying that you DO lose the check mark, so your next one perks will cost you 4 check marks, you just don't lose the perk.  It would be useful if the prosperity question reference the check mark questions since (I think) they are handled the same way (pencil versus pen issues notwithstanding).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hope this helps.

			<body>Cool. Ok then the highlighted part should say “when you &lt;b&gt;would&lt;/b&gt; lose a check mark”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So if you have three check marks (enough to gain a perk), and &lt;b&gt;then lose a check mark&lt;/b&gt;, nothing happens.

			<body>I just noticed that even the monster names (i.e. &quot;[o]Living Bones[/o]&quot;) are under spoiler tags in the main FAQ entry.&lt;br/&gt;At least they are as the subsection headings under the Monster section, though not in other mentions.&lt;br/&gt;That seems excessive to me, and it prevents doing a ctrl+f search (which the preamble of the FAQ suggests) for a monster name from pulling up the main subsection for that monster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And anyone playing the game is going to see the various monster group names anyway when they are pulling out components like the stat cards and action decks for each monster group.

Or do you have to perform the attack in order to be able to do the movement?[/o]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's been discussed here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a target='_blank' href=&quot;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2135583/revisiting-question-eclipse-ability-missing-offici&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2135583/revisiting-question...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And came up again in a more recent thread as well.&lt;br/&gt;</body>

That example seems to imply that you can choose whether to apply an ability card push after an attack modifier has been drawn, which is a no, right?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yeah, the 0 option should be removed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wait, should it?  Choosing to push 0 by not executing either 1) the ability card push or 2) the attmod push is still a valid option.  You can declare that you're skipping a push before the attmod is drawn.  (and could also change your mind and apply an attmod push 1 after the fact, for that matter).  So, 0,1,2 do all feel like fine choices.</body>

The wording is tricky to get concise on this one! </body>

			<body>Thank you very much for this work&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Could you add a small index on the top of the post?  With the titles of the sections... That will help a lot to find what you want.... &lt;br/&gt;Also, if you can remove the spoiler in the name of the ability cards...  I don't think just knowing the name would spoil that much, and it helps to search using Control + F ,  otherwise it is hard 😕 </body>

			<body>So with this ruling, if you kill an elite [o]water eel[/o], goals consider you to have killed a no-class [o]giant viper[/o], since naming doesn't change the type. I would have guessed the correct answer would be elite for class and [o]water eel[/o] for type.</body>

With the titles of the sections... That will help a lot to find what you want.... &lt;br/&gt;Also, if you can remove the spoiler in the name of the ability cards...  I don't think just knowing the name would spoil that much, and it helps to search using Control + F ,  otherwise it is hard 😕 &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oof, that will take a while as I would need to add individual spoiler tags for every card.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before I do this, does anyone have a good spoiler-police type argument not to? I don't recall if the ability card names are considered spoilers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would say that having 3+ card names gives you more information about the class than its name...&lt;br/&gt;If you add class symbol text to icon, Control + F by symbol name should be easy enough to find desired section.</body>
